Make yourself cozy\\n[by the fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouqtX6WWL1U), and let us help you\\nunwrap the gifts Uppy has prepared for you.\\n\\nWe proud of all the improvements and amazing new features and bug fixes we were\\nable to introduce this year. The highlights being: conditional S3 multipart and\\nsigning S3 uploads on the client, speedy handling of 10-50k file uploads,\\nrefresh tokens (useful when the token expires mid-upload for a large amount of\\nfiles / slow connections), server-sent events and new `assemblyOptions` for the\\nTransloadit plugin, Dashboard Single File mode (`singleFileFullScreen`),\\nimproved ETA in the Status Bar, a bunch of new languages, including Hindi,\\nMexican Spanish and Catalan.\\n\\nThis one, however, is a recent Uppy updates post, covering releases from\\n[`3.13.0` to `3.21.0`](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/compare/uppy%403.13.0...uppy%403.21.0):\\nannouncing the switch to Typescript, Dashboard can now auto-install plugins,\\nsupport for Catalan language, a heap of bug fixes for Tus, Companion, AWS S3,\\nand more.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Typescript\\n\\nWe are excited to announce that we are working hard to refactor Uppy Core and\\nall plugins source files to TypeScript. We have a build setup in place that\\ntemporarily supports both `.ts` and `.js` files in our monorepo. And a helper\\nutility that takes a package name and does the initial renaming and Typescript\\nconfig. Then we go through the list of plugins one by one. We begun with\\n`@uppy/utils` and `@uppy/core`, since most other packages depend on those. Now\\nwe are moving to the rest, one by one.\\n\\nThis work so far is only affecting Uppy internals. In published packages we are\\nusing the manually crafted `d.ts` files, as before. We are planning to flip the\\nswitch and introduce some breaking changes in the next Uppy major, due to be\\nreleased in the first quater of 2024.\\n\\n## Core\\n\\n- Allow duplicate files with `onBeforeFileAdded`.\\n- Fixed`onBeforeFileAdded` with Golden Retriever.\\n- Simplify types with class generic and type more events.\\n\\n## Image Editor\\n\\nWe have a whole separate blog post about the recent rotation improvements in the\\nImage Editor, so please read that, if you are interested. Other changes include:\\n\\n- Fixed labels on all buttons, centered the rotation slider label.\\n- Limited cropbox movements.\\n- Fixed to respect `cropperOptions.initialAspectRatio`.\\n- Change the checkered background color, make it semi-transparent.\\n- Fixed granular rotation: `[-45, 45]` instead of `[-45, 44]`.\\n- Removed 1px black lines.\\n- Made `file-editor:cancel` event fire when the Image Editor\u2019s \u201ccancel\u201d button\\n  is pressed.\\n\\n<video muted autoplay loop src=\\"/img/blog/3.13-3.21/crop.mov\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\">\\n</video>\\n\\n<img alt=\\"Editor semi-transparant checkered background\\" src=\\"/img/blog/3.13-3.21/editor.jpg\\" />\\n\\n## Dashboard\\n\\nDashboard can now automatically discover and install compatible plugins without\\n`target` option. This lets you use a much more condense syntax:\\n\\n```js\\nconst uppy = new Uppy()\\n\\t.use(ImageEditor)\\n\\t.use(Dashboard)\\n\\t.use(Webcam)\\n\\t.use(GoogleDrive);\\n```\\n\\n:::tip\\n\\nThe old way via `.use(ImageEditor, { target: Dashboard })` and\\n`.use(Dashboard, { plugins: [\'Webcam\', \'GoogleDrive\'] })` still works, but we\\nencourage you to use the new syntax.\\n\\n:::\\n\\nBug fixes:\\n\\n- Remove `.uppy-Dashboard-isFixed` CSS class when `uppy.close()` is invoked.\\n- When `showAddFilesPanel: true`, `aria-hidden` should be the opposite.\\n- Don\u2019t cancel all files and Assemblies when clicking \u201cdone\u201d.\\n- Update Dashboard\u2019s blue color to meet WCAG contrast requirements.\\n\\n## AWS S3\\n\\n- Fixed `TypeError`, fixed `uploadURL` when using `PUT`.\\n- Pass `signal` as separate arg for backward compat; pass the `uploadURL` back\\n  to the caller.\\n- Refresh file before calling user-defined functions.\\n- Made sure we retry signature request.\\n- Use uppercase HTTP method names.\\n- Call `#setCompanionHeaders` in `setOptions`.\\n\\n## Companion\\n\\nOne of the most notable changes in Companion is on the client side, we\u2019ve made\\nauthentication optional, allowing for more provider types, with publicly\\naccessable links, for example.\\n\\nIn Companion Client we were able to drop the now unnecessary preflight requests,\\nimproving upload speeds and latency yet again.\\n\\nOther notable changes and fixes:\\n\\n- Allow dynamic S3 bucket.\\n- Companion+client stability fixes, error handling and retries.\\n- Catch \u201cinvalid initialization vector\u201d instead of crashing.\\n- Added Onedrive refresh tokens.\\n- Fixed `authProvider` property inconsistency.\\n- Fixed accelerated endpoints for presigned POST.\\n- Fixed double tus uploads.\\n- Fixed onedrive pagination.\\n- Fixed Redis key default TTL.\\n- Fixed Uploader.js metadata normalisation.\\n- Make CSRF protection helpers available to providers.\\n- Refactor `getProtectedHttpAgent` to make TS happy.\\n- Unify redis initialization.\\n- Use deferred length for tus streams.\\n- Fixed a refresh token race condition.\\n- Fixed edge case for pagination on root.\\n- Fixed instagram/facebook auth error regression;

Often users expect this behaviour\\ntoo, leading to some confusion when their images are left with ugly corners\\nafter a rotation.\\n\\nWe implemented this in Uppy\u2019s Image Editor last week, and the solution turned\\nout to be non-trivial. Since this is a pretty ubiquitous task to solve for all\\nimage editors, we decided to release our solution to the world and write out a\\npost about it, instead of keeping it hidden away as part of internal notes.\\n\\n## 3 Steps\\n\\nThere are **3 steps** to our scaling implementation:\\n\\n1. Ask your designer what scaling on rotation should look like\\n1. Find the `.scale()` function\\n1. Calculating the geometry\\n\\n### 1. Trust your designer\\n\\nWhen I first approached this task, my gut-instinct was to go for the \u201crotated\\nrectangle inscribed within another rectangle\u201d solution so that the largest-area\\ninscription possible is achieved. This route turned out to be an unpleasant user\\nexperience, so take this as an important lesson in trusting your designer, and\\nconsulting them first on what the user might want.\\n\\nAlternatively, you can choose to trust our designer\u2019s advice by:\\n\\n- always rotating the image around the center of the image (intersection of the\\n  diagonals)\\n- just enlarging the image to remove any empty corners\\n\\n### 2. Find the `.scale()` function\\n\\nTo enlarge the image in a way that covers empty corners, we first need a scaling\\nfunction. Uppy uses [cropperjs v1.x](https://github.com/fengyuanchen/cropperjs)\\nas an image editing library, which exposes the `cropper.scale(scalingFactor)`\\nfunction. Most image editing libraries are likely to have a similar function,\\nbut of course feel free to code one yourself if you feel up to the challenge.\\n\\nImportantly, the scaling function should\\n[uniformly enlarge](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaling_(geometry)#Uniform_scaling>)\\nthe image _around its center_, where the `scalingFactor` is determined by\\n`desiredHeight/oldHeight`.\\n\\n### 3. Calculate the geometry\\n\\nNow, we want to draw our before-rotation & after-rotation shapes on the same\\npicture, and apply some trigonometry. If you need to brush up on the mathematics\\nbehind this, we recommend watching the following Khan Academy lessons on\\n[how angles work](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/praxis-math/praxis-math-lessons/gtp--praxis-math--lessons--geometry/a/gtp--praxis-math--article--angles--lesson)\\nand\\n[how sines and cosines work](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/hs-geo-trig/hs-geo-trig-ratios-intro/a/finding-trig-ratios-in-right-triangles),\\nas these cover everything you\u2019ll need to follow along.\\n\\nIn the images below, we see what happens on rotation by default. To remove the\\nempty corners, the user would have to drag around the edges of the cropbox. What\\nwe can do instead is scale the image (in the directions shown by the <span\\nstyle={{ color: `rgb(127, 194, 65)` }}>green arrows</span>) so that these\\ncorners disappear.\\n\\n<table style={{ background: `rgb(250, 250, 250)` }}>\\n  <thead>\\n  <tr><th colspan={2}>What happens on rotation</th></tr>\\n  </thead>\\n\\n  <tbody>\\n  <tr>\\n  <td width=\\"50%\\">\\n    <img style={{ maxWidth: 300 }} src=\\"/img/blog/2023-10-25-image-editor/1a.jpg\\" />\\n  </td>\\n\\n  <td width=\\"50%\\">\\n    <img style={{ maxWidth: 340 }} src=\\"/img/blog/2023-10-25-image-editor/1b.jpg\\" />\\n  </td>\\n  </tr>\\n  </tbody>\\n</table>\\n\\nSo, to cover up these checkered corners, we will need to scale the image. If we\\ncover up the larger corner, the smaller corner will get covered up\\nautomatically, so our code takes the form of\\n`scale(Math.max(scalingFactor1, scalingFactor2))`. These two scaling factors are\\ncalculated very similarly, so we\u2019ll only focus on calculating only one of them\\nin this tutorial (although the full solution is given in the conclusion).\\n\\nIn the images below, the <span style={{ color: `rgb(127, 194, 65)` }}>green\\nrectangle</span> represents the desired dimensions of our image after it\u2019s\\nscaled. Our scaling function (and hopefully yours) is defined in such a way that\\nif we have the image of height `h`, and we want to scale it up to height `H`, we\\nneed to execute `.scale(H/h)`. Since we already know `h`, as it\u2019s the height of\\nour image, we only need to find `H` to complete our scaling function.\\n\\n<table style={{ background: \\"rgb(250, 250, 250)\\" }}>\\n  <thead>\\n  <tr><th colspan={2}>We want to find H</th></tr>\\n  </thead>\\n\\n  <tbody>\\n  <tr>\\n  <td width=\\"50%\\">\\n    <img src=\\"/img/blog/2023-10-25-image-editor/2a.jpg\\" />\\n  </td>\\n\\n  <td width=\\"50%\\">\\n    <img src=\\"/img/blog/2023-10-25-image-editor/2b.jpg\\" />\\n  </td>\\n  </tr>\\n  </tbody>\\n</table>\\n\\nFor the rest of the tutorial, the following steps are then automatic - as we\\nknow all the angles in the image, we know the image\u2019s width and height, and we\\nknow to find `H`.\\n\\n<p style={{ padding: 0 }}>The easiest way to go about it, is to first annotate the image with all the\\nrelevant angles. We\u2019ll be using <span\\nstyle={{ color: `rgb(26, 196, 213)` }}>blue </span> for the rotation angle\\n <code>\u03b1</code>, and <span style={{ color: `rgb(224, 128, 193)` }}>pink </span>\\nfor <code>90 - \u03b1</code>:</p>\\n\\n<table style={{ background: \\"rgb(250, 250, 250)\\", textAlign: \\"center\\" }}>\\n  <thead style={{ display: \\"table\\", width: \\"100%\\" }}>\\n  <tr><th>Color all angles</th></tr>\\n  </thead>\\n\\n  <tbody style={{ display: \\"table\\", width: \\"100%\\" }}>\\n  <tr>\\n  <td>\\n    <img style={{ width: 500 }} src=\\"/img/blog/2023-10-25-image-editor/3.jpg\\" />\\n  </td>\\n  </tr>\\n  </tbody>\\n</table>\\n\\nWe can then find `H`, by adding the two outer sides of these triangles.\\n\\n<table style={{ background: \\"rgb(250, 250, 250)\\" }}>\\n  <thead>\\n  <tr><th colspan={2}>Add two triangle sides: H = sin(\u03b1 - 90) * h + sin(\u03b1) * w</th></tr>\\n  </thead>\\n\\n  <tbody>\\n  <tr>\\n  <td width=\\"50%\\">\\n    <img src=\\"/img/blog/2023-10-25-image-editor/4a.jpg\\" />\\n  </td>\\n\\n  <td width=\\"50%\\">\\n    <img src=\\"/img/blog/2023-10-25-image-editor/4b.jpg\\" />\\n  </td>\\n  </tr>\\n  </tbody>\\n</table>\\n\\nSo, now we have our desired `H`! We know one of our scaling factors is `H/h`.\\nNow, we just need to find our other scaling factor, which is `W/w`. This follows\\na similar process, and you can find the calculations as part of the full\\nsolution below.\\n\\n```javascript\\nscalingFactor\\n= max(scalingFactor1, scalingFactor2)\\n= max(H/h, W/w)\\n= max(\\n  (sin(\u03b1 - 90) * h + sin(\u03b1) * w) / h,\\n  (sin(\u03b1) * h + sin(\u03b1 - 90) * w) / w\\n)\\n```\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn Uppy, our code ended up looking like this:\\n\\n```javascript\\nfunction getScalingFactor(w, h, rotationAngle) {\\n\\tconst \u03b1 = Math.abs(toRadians(rotationAngle));\\n\\n\\tconst scalingFactor = Math.max(\\n\\t\\t(Math.sin(\u03b1) * w + Math.cos(\u03b1) * h) / h,\\n\\t\\t(Math.sin(\u03b1) * h + Math.cos(\u03b1) * w) / w,\\n\\t);\\n\\n\\treturn scalingFactor;\\n}\\nconst image = cropper.getImageData();\\nconst scaleFactor = getScalingFactor(image.width, image.height, rotationAngle);\\ncropper.scale(scaleFactor);\\n```\\n\\nYou can see the full version\\n[on GitHub](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/12e08ada02b9080bd5e1d19526bdf8a2010e62a1/packages/%40uppy/image-editor/src/utils/getScaleFactorThatRemovesDarkCorners.js).\\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>Bonus content: our founder\u2019s (Tim Koschuetzki) initial scribbled notes with the solution</summary>\\n  <img src=\\"/img/blog/2023-10-25-image-editor/tim.jpg\\"/>\\n</details>"},{"id":"2023/07/3.3-3.13","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/07/3.3-3.13","editUrl":"https://github.com/transloadit/uppy.io/tree/main/blog/2023-07-3.4-3.13.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-3.4-3.13.md","title":"Uppy 3.3 to 3.13: conditional S3 multipart, signing on the client, speedy handling of 10k files and much much more","description":"This is a big Uppy update post, covering releases from","date":"2023-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 26, 2023","tags":[],"readingTime":8.82,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"email":"merlijn@transloadit.com","name":"Merlijn Vos","id":"merlijn","tagline":"Developer","imageURL":"https://github.com/murderlon.png","key":"murderlon"},{"email":"artur@transloadit.com","name":"Artur Paikin","id":"artur","tagline":"Developer","imageURL":"https://github.com/arturi.png","key":"arturi"},{"email":"antoine@transloadit.com","name":"Antoine du Hamel","id":"aduh95","tagline":"Developer","imageURL":"https://github.com/aduh95.png","key":"aduh95"},{"email":"mikael@transloadit.com","name":"Mikael Finstad","id":"mikael","tagline":"Developer","imageURL":"https://github.com/mifi.png","key":"mifi"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Uppy 3.3 to 3.13: conditional S3 multipart, signing on the client, speedy handling of 10k files and much much more","date":"2023-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","authors":["murderlon","arturi","aduh95","mifi"],"image":"/img/blog/3.4-3.13/single-file-mode.jpg","slug":"2023/07/3.3-3.13","published":true,"toc_max_heading_level":2},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Scaling Images on Rotation","permalink":"/blog/2023-10-25-image-editor"},"nextItem":{"title":"New Uppy.io and docs","permalink":"/blog/2023-05-new-website"}},"content":"<img src=\\"/img/blog/3.4-3.13/single-file-mode.jpg\\" className=\\"border\\" alt=\\"Screenshot of the new Uppy website homepage\\" />\\n\\nThis is a big Uppy update post, covering releases from\\n[`3.3.0` to `3.13.0`](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/compare/uppy%403.4.0...uppy%403.13.0)!\\n\\nIn this issue: the long-awaited unified S3 plugin which can switch between\\nregular and multipart uploads, improved performance when adding and validating\\n10k+ files, and stability improvements and bug fixes.

Here\u2019s the brief version of what you need to know, with\\ndetails to follow in the next section:\\n\\n- `@uppy/aws-s3-multipart` is deprecated. You should use `@uppy/aws-s3` and set\\n  the `shouldUseMultipart: true` option to get the same \u201cmultipart always\\n  enabled\u201d behavior. We plan to keep `@uppy/aws-s3-multipart` around as an alias\\n  for the next major cycle and add a warning at the install when Uppy 4.0.0 will\\n  be released.\\n- `@uppy/aws-s3` now hosts two plugins:\\n  - the legacy one, untouched, to guarantee backward compatibility. We plan to\\n    get rid of it in the next major, we recommend moving away from it and report\\n    if you see something missing in the new plugin.\\n  - the new merged plugin, available if you pass\\n    [`shouldUseMultipart`](https://uppy.io/docs/aws-s3-multipart/#shouldusemultipartfile)\\n    option.\\n\\nOur plan for this merge is to maintain the backward compatibility until the next\\nmajor, while also providing forward compatibility so you can try our new plugin\\nand give us some feedback before we remove the old code for good.\\n\\n### Conditional Multipart Explained\\n\\nMultipart and \u201cregular\u201d uploads have different use cases. The advantages of\\nmultipart uploads are:\\n\\n- **Improved throughput** \u2013 You can upload parts in parallel to improve\\n  throughput.\\n- **Quick recovery from any network issues** \u2013 Smaller part size minimizes the\\n  impact of restarting a failed upload due to a network error.\\n- **Pause and resume object uploads** \u2013 You can upload object parts over time.\\n  After you initiate a multipart upload, there is no expiry; you must explicitly\\n  complete or stop the multipart upload.\\n- **Begin an upload before you know the final object size** \u2013 You can upload an\\n  object as you are creating it.\\n\\nHowever, the downside is _request overhead_, as it needs to do creation,\\nsigning, and completion requests besides the upload requests. For example, if\\nyou are uploading files that are only a couple kilobytes with a 100ms roundtrip\\nlatency, you are spending 400ms on overhead and only a few milliseconds on\\nuploading. This really adds up if you upload a lot of small files.\\n\\nSo now you can use just one plugin, the `@uppy/aws-s3`, and enable multipart\\nconditionally, even per-file:\\n\\n```js\\nuppy.use(AwsS3, {\\n\\tshouldUseMultipart(file) {\\n\\t\\t// Use multipart only for files larger than 100MiB.\\n\\t\\treturn file.size > 100 * 2 ** 20;\\n\\t},\\n});\\n```\\n\\nor\\n\\n```js\\nuppy.use(AwsS3, {\\n\\tshouldUseMultipart: true,\\n});\\n```\\n\\nPlease see the new\\n[`shouldUseMultipart: boolean | function`](https://uppy.io/docs/aws-s3-multipart/#shouldusemultipartfile)\\noption for details.\\n\\n### Signing on the client\\n\\nBy default, when you upload to S3 with Uppy, every file, or every chunk in case\\nof Multipart, needs to be signed on the server. For many small files or files\\nwith many chunks this means a few additional requests per file/chunk of the\\nupload.\\n\\nTo address this issue and speed up the uploads by roughly 20%, we are\\nintroducing a new option: `getTemporarySecurityCredentials: boolean | function`.\\nWhen `true`, both S3 and S3 Multipart uploads will be signed on the client using\\nthe\\n[AWS Security Federation Token](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_GetFederationToken.html),\\ncreated once per user (until it expires) on your backend rather than a unique\\nsigned URL for every single chunk.\\n\\n:::caution\\n\\nYou should opt-in into this only if you are comfortable giving end users direct\\naccess to signing files for your bucket.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n### Stability and bug fixes\\n\\n- We\u2019ve improved the internal handling of `RateLimitedQueue` to make\\n  [retries more robust](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/4424) and\\n  increased\\n  [priority of `abort` and `complete`](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/4542)\\n  requests.\\n- While we were at it, we\u2019ve also fixed\\n  [resuming in single-chunk uploads](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/4528),\\n  and improved\\n  [chunk size calculation](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/4508).\\n- [Golden Retriever integration with S3 Multipart](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/4526)\\n  was fixed.\\n\\nAdditionally, we\u2019ve disabled pause-resume buttons in the UI for remote S3\\nMultipart uploads \u2014\xa0they are not supported on Companion, so the UI now reflects\\nthat.\\n\\n## Core\\n\\nPerformance of adding and uploading big batches of files has (yet again) been\\ngreatly improved with refactors in both Uppy Core and Provider Views (that\u2019s\\nwhat we internally call all remote UIs: Instagram, Unsplash, Dropbox).\\n\\nWe\u2019ve been able to achieve this by\\n[refactoring out totals validation for Restrictions (maxTotalFileSize, maxNumberOfFiles)](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/4402):\\ninstead of doing it for each file, we perform the check at the end, after all\\nthe files have been added/validated. This was confirmed to work with 10k+ files!\\n\ud83d\ude80\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/blog/3.4-3.13/10k-files.jpg\\" className=\\"border\\" alt=\\"Uppy UI with over 10k files selected from a remote source\\" />\\n\\nWe\u2019ve also fixed an issue with delayed throttled progress events, which could\\nlead to incorrect progress.\\n\\n## Transloadit\\n\\n### assemblyOptions\\n\\nWe\u2019ve introduced a new option called\\n[`assemblyOptions: object | function`](https://uppy.io/docs/transloadit/#assemblyoptions),\\nwhich replaces the `getAssemblyOptions`, `params` and `fields` (those are now\\ndeprecated and will be removed in the next major).\\n\\nHere\u2019s how you can use the new option as an object:\\n\\n```js\\nuppy.use(Transloadit, {\\n\\tassemblyOptions: {\\n\\t\\tparams: {\\n\\t\\t\\tauth: { key: \'key-from-transloadit\' },\\n\\t\\t\\ttemplate_id: \'id-from-transloadit\',\\n\\t\\t\\tsteps: {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t// Overruling Template at runtime\\n\\t\\t\\t},\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t\\tsignature: \'generated-signature\',\\n\\t\\tfields: {\\n\\t\\t\\t// Dynamic or static fields to send along\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t},\\n});\\n```\\n\\nAnd here\u2019s an example with a function, to be able to set meta fields per-file,\\nfor instance:\\n\\n```js\\nuppy.use(Transloadit, {\\n\\tassemblyOptions(file) {\\n\\t\\treturn {\\n\\t\\t\\tparams: {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tauth: { key: \'TRANSLOADIT_AUTH_KEY_HERE\' },\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttemplate_id: \'xyz\',\\n\\t\\t\\t},\\n\\t\\t\\tfields: {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcaption: file.meta.caption,\\n\\t\\t\\t},\\n\\t\\t};\\n\\t},\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### Server-sent events\\n\\nHistorically Transloadit supported progress updates via Socket.io. It is a\\nrobust and stable package, but came with a \u201cprice-tag\u201d in the form of bundle\\nsize:\\n[38.3 kB Minified](https://bundlephobia.com/package/socket.io-client@4.7.1). So\\nit\u2019s been on our minds for a while to replace it with something more\\nlightweight, without breaking backwards-compatibility for the older clients (so\\nsimply removing Socket.io on the server in favor of plain WebSockets is not\\ndesireable).\\n\\nThe answer \u2014\\n[Server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events).\\nIt\u2019s a simple low-overhead one-way connection from Transloadit servers to\\n`@uppy/transloadit`. As was the case with Socket.io, we fall back to HTTP\\npolling every 2 seconds if SSE connection fails for some reason.\\n\\nSocket.io is still around in `@uppy/transloadit`, but will be removed soon, once\\nSSE proves itself in production.\\n\\n### Bug fixes\\n\\n- Reset `tus` key in the file on error, so retried files are re-uploaded.\\n- Clean up event listener to prevent cancelled assemblies.\\n- Make sure `fields` is not nullish when there are no files in Assembly.\\n\\n## Companion\\n\\n### Refresh tokens\\n\\nWe\u2019ve\\n[implemented refresh tokens](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/4448) for\\nDropbox and Google Drive to solve issued where tokens would expire in the middle\\nof a long upload and then the upload would fail.\\n\\nHere\u2019s how it\u2019s implemented in Companion:\\n\\n- We changed the logic when receiving a 401 from Companion, Uppy will now call a\\n  new `/:provider/refresh-token` endpoint which will give uppy a new access\\n  token.\\n- `refresh_token` is now stored inside uppy auth token along with `access_token`\\n  (encrypted JWT) for providers that give a refresh token (before only\\n  `access_token` was stored, now we store both as a `JSON.stringify`\u2019d\\n  document).\\n\\n### Bug fixes and improvements\\n\\n- Fixed a bug with non-ASCII metadata crashed Companion. The AWS SDK doesn\u2019t\\n  encode metadata by itself, so now we do it in Companion.\\n- Switched from aws-sdk v2 to @aws-sdk/\\\\* v3\\n- Upgraded Grant dependency\\n- We now send expire info for non-multipart uploads and added connection\\n  keep-alive to Dropbox to improve connection stability\\n- Merged Provider and SearchProvider internal remote source classes.\\n- Increased max limits for remote file list operations and fixed part listing in\\n  S3\\n\\n## Url\\n\\nWe\u2019ve upgraded the Url plugin to use `filename` from `Content-Disposition`\\nheader of the file you are importing, instead of relying on the url (but kept\\nthe latter as a fallback) (#4489). So now your files have proper names instead\\nof `noname`.\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/blog/3.4-3.13/url-name.jpg\\" className=\\"border\\" alt=\\"Uppy UI with a file selected with the Url plugin\\" />\\n\\n## Dashboard and Status Bar\\n\\nSingle File Mode has been improved to adapt to height of less than 400px \u2014 the\\nUI turns back to grid in this case. We are also not using `fit: cover` anymore\\nto avoid cropping important parts of the image:\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/blog/3.4-3.13/single-file-mode.jpg\\" className=\\"border\\" alt=\\"Uppy UI with single file\\" />\\n\\nWe\u2019ve also added an option to disable the Single File mode, as it can be\\nunwanted in certain use cases:\\n[`singleFileFullScreen`](https://uppy.io/docs/dashboard/#singlefilefullscreen).\\n\\nIf you wrapped Uppy Dashboard in a `<form>` element, it could be accidentally\\nsubmitted when a user pressed Enter to save meta fields or entering urls. Now\\nwe\u2019ve\\n[added a `form=\\"\\"` attribute, connected to an empty `<form>`](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/4283)\\nin document root to prevent the outer form from being submitted.\\n\\nA bug has been fixed that allowed clicking on buttons and links in Dashboard\\n[disabled mode](https://uppy.io/docs/dashboard/#disabled).\\n\\nRange selection of remote files has been fixed, you can now shift+click to\\nselect multiple files again. We\u2019ve added the `VirtualList` component which is\\nalready used in Uppy \u201cselected files\u201d screen to remote file lists. So now\\nscrolling through 10k+ files is breeze \ud83c\udf2c\ufe0f\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/blog/3.4-3.13/range-selection.jpg\\" className=\\"border\\" alt=\\"Dashboard UI with range selection\\" />\\n\\n### Status Bar\\n\\n- Fixed ETA when Uppy recovers its state.\\n- Remove throttled component to fix a bug where state would become shared\\n  between multiple status bars on a page.\\n\\n## Locales\\n\\nWe\u2019ve added support for Hindi and Mexican Spanish. French, Spanish and Chinese\\nlocales have been improved.\\n\\n## Uploaders\\n\\n- Fixed an issue where sockets were opened right away, ignoring the\\n  `RateLimitedQueue`, which led to bugs in all plugins that handle remote\\n  uploads. Additionally, when file is removed (or all are canceled), we call\\n  `controller.abort` on queued requests.\\n- Fixed a bug with sockets being closed, while the upload was still in progress.\\n- In XHR Upload we\u2019ve added support for arrays in metadata and an\\n  `\'upload-stalled\'` event.\\n\\n## Miscellaneous\\n\\n- `@uppy/golden-retriever` has been refactored refactor to modernize the\\n  codebase.\\n- We\u2019ve switched more non-critical errors to warnings.\\n- Improved fallbacks for the drag & drop API.\\n- The React Native example has been modernized and updated.\\n- `uppy.resetProgress()` in Core has been fixed.\\n\\nWe hope you\u2019ve enjoyed this update posts and all the fixes and features we\u2019ve\\nworked on!

Three `minor`\\nreleases ago we\u2019ve introduced Uppy 3.0. It\u2019s time to give you an update on\\nwhat\u2019s been cooking in the Uppy-Transloadit headquarters (besides cranberry\\nsauce) for the past couple of months.\\n\\nIn short: AWS S3 Multipart stability improvements, Single File Mode for the\\nDashboard, more tests and bugfixes, new locales.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Safer AWS S3 Multipart uploads on slow connections\\n\\n`@uppy/aws-s3-multipart` has been serving well for people who prefer a\\n_client-to_s3_ setup with Uppy. However, some uploads could occasionally fail in\\npoor network conditions. It turned out, simultaneously signing and uploading\\nmany chunks at once saturated the HTTP/1.1 connection limit, which lead to\\nsignatures expiring by the time Uppy started uploading the next chunk.\\n\\nWe\u2019ve refactored our internal queue mechanism to sign chunks right before we\\nbegin uploading them to the remote server. When the upload is paused, the queue\\nis emptied and re-populated again on resume. The default `limit` for this plugin\\nhas been set to `6` and the default S3 signature expiry has been lifted from\\n`300` to `800` seconds.\\n\\n## Single File Mode\\n\\nOften times people only want to upload a single file (most commonly an image)\\nvia Uppy. But the Dashboard UI is tailored to handling many files at once, and\\nit used to display the single image as a small, sad-looking block in the corner.\\nThis ends now! (Actually, it ended a few releases ago, figure of speech).\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/blog/3.1-3.3/single-file-mode.jpg\\" className=\\"border\\" />\\n\\nWith only one file selected, we\u2019ll display it large and centered, and make sure\\nto re-generate the image preview so it\u2019s `600px` wide, looking nice and sleek on\\nmodern displays.\\n\\nSee [PR #4188](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/4188) for more\\nscreenshots.\\n\\n## Bug fixes and Upgrades\\n\\nWe\u2019ve upgraded Typescript to `v4.8` and Jest to `v29`, among other tools and\\npackages.\\n\\nWe are now additionally testing that Uppy packages are correctly bundled with\\nthe latest Rollup, Webpack, Parcel, Vite, and ESBuild.\\n\\nNotable bug fixes:\\n\\n- XHR Upload: Queue requests for socket token for remote files\\n- Core: Prevent crashes when a file is removed before the upload starts\\n- Golden Retriever: Fixed upload retries\\n- AWS S3 and XHR Upload: Fixed Cannot mark a queued request as done in\\n  MiniXHRUpload\\n- Webcam: Set default videoConstraints\\n- Image Editor: Fix controls in small Dashboard\\n\\nSee the full list in the\\n[changelog](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).\\n\\n## Companion\\n\\nAnd of course, this festive season we are not forgetting Companion under the\\ntree:\\n\\n- Throttle progress by time\\n- Added workaround for S3 accelerated endpoints\\n- Send expire info for non-multipart uploads\\n- Send expiry time alongside S3 signed requests\\n- Added support for AbortSignal\\n- Prevent preflight race condition\\n\\n## Locales\\n\\nUzbek language pack was added, while Polish and Ukrainian language packs were\\nupdated.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThat\u2019s it for our updates!

The plugin only works\\nwith Dashboard and allows you to enable all the above sources in a single line.\\n\\nBefore, you had to manually include every cloud provider / remote source:\\n\\n```js\\nuppy\\n\\t.use(Instagram, {\\n\\t\\tcompanionUrl: COMPANION_URL,\\n\\t\\tcompanionAllowedHosts: COMPANION_ALLOWED_HOSTS,\\n\\t})\\n\\t.use(GoogleDrive, {\\n\\t\\tcompanionUrl: COMPANION_URL,\\n\\t\\tcompanionAllowedHosts: COMPANION_ALLOWED_HOSTS,\\n\\t})\\n\\t.use(OneDrive, {\\n\\t\\tcompanionUrl: COMPANION_URL,\\n\\t\\tcompanionAllowedHosts: COMPANION_ALLOWED_HOSTS,\\n\\t})\\n\\t.use(Instagram, {\\n\\t\\tcompanionUrl: COMPANION_URL,\\n\\t\\tcompanionAllowedHosts: COMPANION_ALLOWED_HOSTS,\\n\\t})\\n\\t.use(Facebook, {\\n\\t\\tcompanionUrl: COMPANION_URL,\\n\\t\\tcompanionAllowedHosts: COMPANION_ALLOWED_HOSTS,\\n\\t})\\n\\t.use(Unsplash, {\\n\\t\\tcompanionUrl: COMPANION_URL,\\n\\t\\tcompanionAllowedHosts: COMPANION_ALLOWED_HOSTS,\\n\\t});\\n// ...\\n```\\n\\nAfter:\\n\\n```js\\nuppy.use(RemoteSources, { companionUrl: COMPANION_URL });\\n```\\n\\nTo get started, check out the [`RemoteSources` docs](/docs/remote-sources).\\n\\n## Robodog ends its service\\n\\nUppy is flexible and extensible through plugins, but the integration code could\\nsometimes prove daunting. This is what brought [Robodog](/docs/robodog/) to\\nlife. It served as an alternative with the same features, but with a more\\nergonomic and minimal API.\\n\\nIt did, however, come with its own set of new problems:\\n\\n- Robodog tries to do the exact same thing as Uppy, but looks like an entirely\\n  different product.\\n- Users are faced with a confusing choice between using Robodog or using Uppy\\n  directly.\\n- Robodog is more ergonomic because it\u2019s limited. When hitting such a limit, the\\n  user has to refactor everything to Uppy using plugins.\\n\\nThis has now led us to deprecating Robodog and embracing Uppy for its strong\\nsuits: modularity and flexibility. At the same time, we\u2019re also introducing\\nsomething to take away some of the repetitive integration code:\\n[`@uppy/remote-sources`](/docs/remote-sources).\\n\\nAre you using Robodog in your code base? You can check out the\\n[migration guide](https://uppy.io/docs/guides/migration-guides/#migrate-from-robodog-to-uppy-plugins)\\nto see how you can transition to Uppy plugins without losing functionality. We\\nhave committed ourselves to extending Robodog support for one year to give our\\nusers more time to migrate.\\n\\n## Native mobile camera\\n\\nAs you are probably aware, Uppy\u2019s Webcam plugin provides a nice UI for desktop\\ndevices to take pictures and record videos. Up until 3.0, the same UI was\\nutilized on mobile as well.\\n\\nSince most mobile devices have a system UI for taking pictures and recording\\nvideos \u2013 which is usually better than any custom solution we can offer \u2013 we\u2019ve\\nintroduced a new option called `mobileNativeCamera` for the Webcam plugin:\\n\\n```js\\nuppy.use(Webcam, {\\n\\tmobileNativeCamera: isMobile({ tablet: true }),\\n});\\n```\\n\\nBy default, it uses the [`is-mobile`](https://github.com/juliangruber/is-mobile)\\npackage to detect mobile devices, like smartphones and tablets, but you can\\nmanually set this option to `true` or `false` if you wish. When enabled, instead\\nof the usual Camera/Webcam Uppy UI, users will be presented with buttons that\\nopen their device\u2019s native camera interface:\\n\\n![Uppy native camera UI](/img/blog/3.0/native-camera.jpg)\\n\\n[`videoConstraints.facingMode`](/docs/webcam/#videoConstraints) is also\\nsupported by this option via the\\n[`capture`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/capture)\\nattribute (in the browsers and devices that respect it).\\n\\n```js\\nuppy.use(Webcam, {\\n\\tvideoConstraints: {\\n\\t\\tfacingMode: \'user\',\\n\\t},\\n});\\n```\\n\\nThe same applies to [`modes`](/docs/webcam/#modes), allowing you to enable only\\nvideo or only photos.\\n\\n## Devotedly stable\\n\\nSince the Uppy 2.7.0 release, **we\u2019ve fixed over 95 bugs!** This includes fixes\\nto bugs that made uploading less stable, documentation corrections, and\\ndependency upgrades.\\n\\n## Companion turns 4.0\\n\\nEveryone\u2019s favorite Companion also received some love.\\n\\n### Streaming upload\\n\\nStreaming upload can now also be enabled in Companion when using Tus. This comes\\nwith greatly improved upload speeds and allows uploading up to hundreds of\\ngigabytes without needing a large server storage. We found that this improves\\nspeeds by about 37% for a Google Drive upload of a 1 GB file\\n([source](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/4046#issuecomment-1235697937)).\\nThis feature was also available before Companion 4.0, but it didn\u2019t work with\\nTus until now.\\n\\nWith streaming upload disabled (default), the whole file will be downloaded\\nfirst. The upload will then start when the download has completely finished.\\n\\nWhen streaming upload is enabled, Companion will start downloading the file from\\nthe provider (such as Google Drive), while at the same time starting the upload\\nto the destination (such as Tus), and sending every chunk of data consecutively.\\n\\nFor more information, see the [Companion docs](/docs/companion/).\\n\\n### Event emitter\\n\\nCompanion now has a server-side event emitter that can be used to detect when\\nuploads start, finish and fail, without having to depend on the client (so it\\nworks even when users have closed their browser).\\n\\nExample code:\\n\\n```js\\nconst { app, emitter } = companion.app(options);\\n\\nemitter.on(\'upload-start\', ({ token }) => {\\n\\tconsole.log(\'Upload started\', token);\\n\\n\\tfunction onUploadEvent({ action, payload }) {\\n\\t\\tif (action === \'success\') {\\n\\t\\t\\temitter.off(token, onUploadEvent); // avoid listener leak\\n\\t\\t\\tconsole.log(\'Upload finished\', token, payload.url);\\n\\t\\t} else if (action === \'error\') {\\n\\t\\t\\temitter.off(token, onUploadEvent); // avoid listener leak\\n\\t\\t\\tconsole.error(\'Upload failed\', payload);\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n\\temitter.on(token, onUploadEvent);\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### Internal improvements\\n\\nCompanion\u2019s internal request code and Providers have been rewritten to\\n`async`/`await`, which has greatly simplified and reduced the amount of code.\\nThis will lead to less bugs and security issues, and make it easier to implement\\nnew custom Providers.\\n\\nWe have also replaced the deprecated\\n[`request`](https://github.com/request/request) library with\\n[`got`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got). This also removed the need for\\n[`purest`](https://github.com/simov/purest).\\n\\n### And more!\\n\\n- [Compressor](/docs/compressor) is officially stable. The Compressor plugin for\\n  Uppy optimizes images (JPEG, PNG), saving on average up to 60% in size. It has\\n  proven itself through extensive battle testing.\\n- [AWS S3 Multipart](/docs/aws-s3-multipart) also became more stable this\\n  release, as a result of us hammering out some of the last edge cases with lots\\n  of files and/or huge files.\\n- React 18 is now supported in [`@uppy/react`](/docs/react), Vue 3 is supported\\n  for [`@uppy/vue`](/docs/vue), and Angular 14 for\\n  [`@uppy/angular`](/docs/angular).\\n- Our [examples](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/tree/main/examples) have\\n  received a fresh round of updates to keep them relevant.\\n\\n---\\n\\n![Animate picture of a visibly happy dog getting a head massage](/img/blog/3.0/dog-enjoys.gif)\\n\\nFor more details, see the full\\n[changelog](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1300) and\\nthe [migration guide](/docs/migration-guides.html).\\n\\nThat\u2019s it from us for now! As you can see, Uppy may be slowly turning into an\\nold dog, but we\u2019re still committed to keep teaching it new tricks. We hope\\nyou\u2019ll enjoy this latest major release, and all the features and improvements it\\nincludes.

Since our\\n[most recent post](https://uppy.io/blog/2021/12/2.1-2.3/) in December, Uppy has\\ncontinued to receive a steady stream of updates. This post covers all the\\nimprovements made in Uppy versions 2.4 through 2.7. Changes and additions\\ninclude: image compression, improved Transloadit rate limiting and a lighter\\nDashboard plugin. We\u2019ve also moved our end-to-end tests to Cypress, and are\\nslowly converting plugins to ES modules (ESM).\\n\\n<img className=\\"border\\" alt=\\"Uppy Compressor plugin showing compressed images notification\\" src=\\"/img/blog/2.4-2.7/compressor.jpg\\" />\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Compressor\\n\\nSome of the most commonly uploaded files on the internet are images \u2014 photos,\\nstock images, screenshots, and documents scans. Uppy now includes a new plugin\\ncalled `@uppy/compressor` that optimizes images (JPEG, PNG), saving on average\\nup to 60% in size (roughly 18 MB for 10 images). It uses\\n[Compressor.js](https://github.com/fengyuanchen/compressorjs) under the hood.\\n\\n[Read the docs](https://uppy.io/docs/compressor/) and\\n[try Compressor in action](https://uppy.io/examples/dashboard/).\\n\\n```js\\nimport Uppy from \'@uppy/core\';\\nimport Compressor from \'@uppy/compressor\';\\n\\nconst uppy = new Uppy();\\nuppy.use(Compressor);\\n```\\n\\n`@uppy/compressor` is also the first plugin that we are releasing as ESM,\\nbackwards compatible as CJS, to test out how this works. Please report any\\nissues.\\n\\n## Hosted Companion custom credentials\\n\\nIt cannot be overstated that our\\n[Transloadit-hosted](https://transloadit.com/docs/sdks/uppy/)\\n[Companion Plugin](https://uppy.io/docs/companion/) is the easiest secure way to\\nallow your users pick files from cloud sources like Google Drive, Instagram,\\nBox, etc. via Uppy. Up until now, however, that meant your users had to\\nauthenticate their cloud account with Transloadit, preventing you from showing\\nyour own logo instead. That has now been fixed! Head to `Transloadit Console` /\\n`Credentials`, scroll down to `Third-party Credentials`, click on\\n`Add new Credentials`, select `Companion OAuth`, and voil\xe0!\\n\\n<img className=\\"border\\" alt=\\"Transloadit Companion 3rd party credentials\\" src=\\"/img/blog/2.4-2.7/companion-3rd-party-oauth.jpg\\" />\\n\\nTry it out with the\\n[free Transloadit Community Plan \u2014 5GB / month and access to Companion](https://transloadit.com/pricing/).\\n\\n## Transloadit rate limiting\\n\\nWe\u2019ve added rate limiting to Transloadit\\n[assembly creation and status polling](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/3429),\\nand [tus retries](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/3394):\\n\\n> When the remote server responds with HTTP 429, all requests are paused for a\\n> while in the hope that it can resolve the rate limiting. Failed requests are\\n> now also queued up after the retry delay. Before, they were scheduled for\\n> retry without being queued up, which would sometimes end up overflowing the\\n> limit option.\\n\\nAs a result of this change, uploading many files at once has become even more\\nrobust.\\n\\n## Move to ESM\\n\\nThe JavaScript ecosystem is moving towards ESM, and we want to follow suit. We\\nare slowly starting to adopt ESM in Uppy packages. To do so, we integrated a\\nplugin into our build system that transpiles ESM source code to CommonJS syntax,\\nwhich is distributed with the npm package. Nothing will change on your end,\\nthough \u2013 we know that not everyone is using tooling that support ESM, so we\u2019re\\nholding on to CommonJS for the time being. Our plan is to refactor all official\\nUppy plugins to ESM before Uppy 3.0 is released, and drop CommonJS in favor of\\nESM in the npm packages at that point.\\n\\nFor details, see [PR 3468](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/3468).\\n\\n## End to end: move to Cypress\\n\\nUppy has had end to end from the start, but the developer experience was less\\nthan ideal with custom Webdriver.io + Selenium. The transition to\\n[Cypress](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/3444) allows us to write\\ntests with ease and comfort, backed by great documentation.\\n\\n## Lighter Bundle\\n\\nWe continue to look for ways to reduce Uppy\u2019s bundle size and modernize our\\nbuild toolchain. This time, we\u2019ve replaced the\\n[Exifr.js](https://github.com/exif-js/exif-js) legacy bundle with the modern one\\nwithout IE polyfills. Our Browserify bundler has been replaced with a modern and\\nmore efficient ESBuild.\\n\\n## Companion improvements\\n\\n- Improved private IP check (#3403)\\n- Implement periodic ping functionality (#3246)\\n- Fix broken thumbnails for Box and Dropbox (#3460)\\n- Fix unpslash author meta, sanitize metadata to strings and improve Companion\\n  tests (#3478)\\n\\nThat\u2019s it for today!

First of all is the\\nlong-awaited Audio plugin to record and upload live audio directly. We then\\nworked on adding a fast and efficient streaming interface to Companion and made\\nUnsplash production ready. Housekeeping was also part of the job: we made Status\\nBar improvements, moved from npm to Yarn 3, did some refactoring, and updated\\ndependencies.\\n\\nLast but not least, we got the issue count down from around 110 since 2.0.0 to\\naround 45 now.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Audio plugin\\n\\nUppy now has a new `@uppy/audio` plugin for recording audio memos, sounds,\\njingling bells, Christmas carols, and all your holiday cheer.

Being fully brand\\ncompliant with Unsplash means it\u2019s now production ready. You can demo the plugin\\non the [website](https://uppy.io/examples/dashboard) or read the\\n[docs](https://uppy.io/docs/unsplash/).\\n\\n## New streaming interface for Companion\\n\\n[Companion][companion] handles the server-to-server communication between your\\nserver and file storage providers such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Instagram, and\\nthe like. This bypasses the client (so a 5 GB video isn\u2019t eating into your\\nusers\u2019 data plans) and files are directly uploaded to the final destination.\\nCompanion is made to be effortlessly integrate-able with Uppy.\\n\\nIt used to work by downloading the requested file from a remote provider on the\\nserver to then start uploading it to the destination. This did the job, but it\u2019s\\nwasn\u2019t ideal.\\n\\nWe now built streaming support into Companion, which means the download and\\nupload can happen simultaneously. This can result in **two times faster\\nuploads**, because we no longer have to wait for files to finish downloading\\nbefore starting the upload process. It\u2019s especially useful for large files and\\nremoves the need for a lot of storage space on the server, as data will be\\nbuffered in memory.\\n\\nYou can enable this by setting `streamingUpload` in the Companion\\n[options](https://uppy.io/docs/companion/#Options).\\n\\n**NOTE:** Streaming is turned off by default. Do not turn it on yet if you\u2019re\\nusing TUS for uploads, due to\\n[this tus-js-client bug](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/issues/275).\\n\\nInterested in using Companion? You can use Transloadit-hosted Companion on every\\n[Plan](https://transloadit.com/pricing/).\\n\\n## Status Bar error state improvements\\n\\nThe Status Bar plugin would get confused about upload errors in Uppy, and we\u2019ve\\naddressed this:\\n\\n- The error state is now shown in case of only _one_ failed file instead of\\n  _all_ failed files. The plugin used to get stuck in the uploading state when a\\n  single file failed.\\n- Added \u201cX of X files uploaded\u201d below \u201cUpload failed\u201d for extra context.\\n- Improved the error details button styling in the Status Bar and the file info\\n  card.\\n- Status Bar state is set to complete if the user manually removes the failed\\n  files.\\n\\n![status bar improvements screenshot](/img/blog/2.1-2.3/status-bar-improvements.jpg)\\n\\n## Internal housekeeping\\n\\n### Yarn v3 instead of npm\\n\\nWe\u2019ve switched the Uppy repo to Yarn 3 to improve package install performance.\\nWith our complex dependency graph and over thirty packages in a monorepo, we are\\nseeing install times reduced by more than a few minutes!\\n\\nWe are using [Corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack) to make sure all\\nUppy contributors are using the same version of Yarn. If you are an Uppy\\ncontributor, please run the following commands to enable Corepack:\\n\\n```sh\\ncorepack -v || npm i -g corepack # install Corepack if not already installed\\nyarn -v || corepack enable # install Yarn through Corepack if not already installed\\nyarn || corepack yarn install # install npm dependencies using yarn\\n```\\n\\n[View the PR](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/3237)\\n\\n### Refactor locale scripts & generate types and docs\\n\\nThis is an internal change, but important nonetheless. Our locales now live in a\\nseparate `locale.js` file for every plugin instead of `this.defaultLocale` in\\nthe class. The docs and types are automatically updated when we add or remove\\nnew locale strings.\\n\\n[View the PR](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/3276).\\n\\n### Automated release scripts\\n\\nA lot of things need to happen when we\u2019re publishing a new release. A complete\\nredo of the automation script is now available for quick and secure releases.\\n\\nHere are some highlights:\\n\\n- Releaser runs `yarn release` and will get a series of\\n  [prompts](https://github.com/terkelg/prompts) to set up a release.\\n- A changelog will be generated.\\n- The contributions table will be updated.\\n- GitHub Actions will create a release candidate pull request.\\n- When approved, GitHub Actions automatically merges, publishes to the npm\\n  public registry, and creates CDN bundles.\\n\\n[View the PR](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/3304).\\n\\n## And more\\n\\n- google-drive: plugin has been updated for brand compliance (#3178)\\n- google-drive: sort Google Drive list by name #3069\\n- status-bar: now shows all details on mobile when `showProgressDetails` is\\n  `true` (#3174)\\n- core: move `Uppy` class to its own module (#3225)\\n- angular: fix component crash by loosening `package.json` version constraints\\n  (#3210)\\n- drop-target: exposed events (#3238)\\n- companion: add `maxFileSize` option in companion for safety #3159\\n- companion: new AWS S3 multipart presigned URL batching endpoint #3056\\n- companion: improve CORS default headers #3167\\n- companion: use GET instead of HEAD for `getURLMeta` for better server\\n  compatibility (especially signed S3 URLs) #3048\\n- companion: deprecate missing `uploadUrls` option (will be required in the\\n  future) #3182\\n- companion: close window on auth callback error and show error to user #3143\\n- companion: cut off length of file names to avoid AWS error #3048\\n- companion: safely escape `<script>` injected code in Companion\u2019s send-token.js\\n  #3101\\n- companion: upgrade aws-sdk #3334\\n- companion: improve logging #3103\\n- companion: change Provider/SearchProvider API to async and use streams instead\\n  #3159\\n\\nHappy Holidays from the Uppy team!

We want to take this opportunity to break with the past, to make the\\nproject leaner \u2013 and to pave the way for an even brighter future for Uppy!\\n\\n<img className=\\"border\\" alt=\\"Uppy 2.0 UI with files\\" src=\\"/img/blog/2.0/uppy-ui-with-files.jpg\\" />\\n\\n## Table of Contents\\n\\n- [Highlights since 1.0](#Highlights-since-1-0)\\n- [Smaller bundles](#Smaller-bundles)\\n- [Faster](#Faster)\\n- [Preact X and upgraded dependencies](#Preact-X-and-upgraded-dependencies)\\n- [`Plugin` is replaced with `BasePlugin` and `UIPlugin`](#Plugin-is-replaced-with-BasePlugin-and-UIPlugin)\\n- [Strict TypeScript types by default](#Strict-TypeScript-types-by-default)\\n- [Batch pre-signing URL\'s for AWS S3 Multipart](#Batch-pre-signing-URLs-for-AWS-S3-Multipart)\\n- [And more](#And-more)\\n- [What future remains for 1.0?](#What-future-remains-for-1-0?)\\n- [That\'s it](#That\u2019s-it)\\n\\n<video alt=\\"Video demo showing updated Uppy 2.0 UI\\" muted autoplay loop>\\n  <source src=\\"/images/uppy-2-0-demo-aug-2021.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n  Your browser does not support the video tag: https://uppy.io/images/uppy-2-0-demo-aug-2021.mp4\\n</video>\\n\\n## Highlights since 1.0\\n\\nA lot of things have happened since we released Uppy 1.0 in April of 2019. In\\ncase you have missed some of our 1.x releases, here is a small overview. We have\\nadded:\\n\\n- Official integrations for [Vue](/blog/2020/11/1.23/)\\n  ([3](/blog/2021/04/1.27/)), [Angular](/blog/2021/07/1.30/), and\\n  [Svelte](/blog/2020/12/1.24/)\\n- [Hooks](/blog/2020/12/1.24/) for the React integration\\n- Support for picking files from [Box](/blog/2020/11/1.23/),\\n  [Unsplash](/blog/2020/10/1.22/), [Facebook](/blog/2020/04/1.10/), and\\n  [OneDrive](/blog/2020/04/1.10/)\\n- [\u201cGhost\u201d files](/blog/2021/05/1.29/), as part of a revamped Golden Retriever\\n  plugin, which makes recovering lost files even more intuitive\\n- Support for 25 more languages (bringing it to a total of\\n  [37](/docs/locales/#List-of-locale-packs))\\n- [Dark mode](/blog/2020/04/1.13/)\\n- an [Image Editor](/blog/2020/07/1.18-image-editor/)\\n- And four new core team members: [@ajkachnic](https://github.com/ajkachnic),\\n  [@mifi](https://github.com/mifi), [@aduh95](https://github.com/aduh95), and\\n  [@murderlon](https://github.com/murderlon)\\n\\n## Smaller bundles\\n\\nWith 2.0, following in the footsteps of Microsoft, we are dropping support for\\nIE11. As a result, we are able to remove all built-in polyfills, and the new\\nbundle size is **25% smaller**! If you want your app to still support older\\nbrowsers (such as IE11), you may need to add the following polyfills to your\\nbundle:\\n\\n- [abortcontroller-polyfill](https://github.com/mo/abortcontroller-polyfill)\\n- [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js)\\n- [md-gum-polyfill](https://github.com/mozdevs/mediaDevices-getUserMedia-polyfill)\\n- [resize-observer-polyfill](https://github.com/que-etc/resize-observer-polyfill)\\n- [whatwg-fetch](https://github.com/github/fetch)\\n\\nIf you\'re using a bundler, you need import these before Uppy:\\n\\n```js\\nimport \'core-js\';\\nimport \'whatwg-fetch\';\\nimport \'abortcontroller-polyfill/dist/polyfill-patch-fetch\';\\n// Order matters here: AbortController needs fetch, which needs Promise (provided by core-js).\\n\\nimport \'md-gum-polyfill\';\\nimport ResizeObserver from \'resize-observer-polyfill\';\\n\\nwindow.ResizeObserver ??= ResizeObserver;\\n\\nexport { default } from \'@uppy/core\';\\nexport * from \'@uppy/core\';\\n```\\n\\nIf you\'re using Uppy from a CDN, we now provide two bundles: one for up-to-date\\nbrowsers that do not include polyfills and use modern syntax, and one for legacy\\nbrowsers. When migrating, be mindful about the types of browsers you want to\\nsupport:\\n\\n```html\\n\x3c!-- Modern browsers (recommended) --\x3e\\n<script src=\\"https://releases.transloadit.com/uppy/v2.0.1/uppy.min.js\\"><\/script>\\n\\n\x3c!-- Legacy browsers (IE11+) --\x3e\\n<script\\n\\tnomodule\\n\\tsrc=\\"https://releases.transloadit.com/uppy/v2.0.1/uppy.legacy.min.js\\"\\n><\/script>\\n<script type=\\"module\\">\\n\\timport \'https://releases.transloadit.com/uppy/v2.0.1/uppy.min.js\';\\n<\/script>\\n```\\n\\nPlease note that while you may be able to get 2.0 to work in IE11 this way, we\\ndo not officially support it anymore.\\n\\n## Faster\\n\\nUppy now loads faster thanks to the decreased bundle size. With Uppy 1.0, adding\\nmany files (hundreds or even thousands) used to take dozens of seconds. Uppy 2.0\\ndoes the same thing in mere milliseconds! So, at least for this specific use\\ncase, we feel comfortable in claiming that you may see your loading times go\\n**up to a thousand times faster**.\\n\\nThis was made possible by avoiding having to re-render all the file components\\nwhenever something changes, using `memoize` and `virtual-list` (allowing us to\\nonly render what is actually visible on screen). In addition, multiple files are\\nnow added to state in one go via `uppy.addFiles(Array)` as opposed to before,\\nwhen `uppy.addFile(File)` + `uppy.setState` were being called in a loop.\\n\\nBefore optimizations:\\n\\n![](/img/blog/2.0/uppy-performance-before.gif)\\n\\nAnd after:\\n\\n![](/img/blog/2.0/uppy-performance-after.gif)\\n\\n## Preact X and upgraded dependencies\\n\\nWe\u2019ve upgraded almost all of Uppy\u2019s dependencies. This includes the migration to\\nPreact X. All plugins that depend on Preact have been upgraded from `8.2.9` to\\nthe latest version `10.5.13`. If you\u2019d like your custom plugin to continue\\nworking with Uppy 2.0, it also needs to be using latest version of Preact.\\n\\nOther notable upgrades include browserify to `v10`, typescript to `v4.3`,\\nautoprefixer to `v10`, and lerna to `v4`.\\n\\n## `Plugin` is replaced with `BasePlugin` and `UIPlugin`\\n\\n[`@uppy/core`][core] provided a `Plugin` class for creating plugins. This was\\nused for any official plugin, but also for users who want to create their own\\ncustom plugin. However, `Plugin` always came bundled with Preact, even if the\\nplugin itself didn\'t add any UI elements.\\n\\nAs of Uppy 2.0.0, `Plugin` has been replaced with `BasePlugin` and `UIPlugin`.\\n`BasePlugin` is the minimum you need to create a plugin and `UIPlugin` adds\\nPreact for rendering user interfaces.\\n\\n**Note:** some bundlers will include `UIPlugin` (and therefore Preact) if you\\nimport from `@uppy/core`. To make sure this does not happen, you can import\\n`Uppy` and `BasePlugin` directly:\\n\\n```js\\nimport Uppy from \'@uppy/core/lib/Uppy.js\';\\nimport BasePlugin from \'@uppy/core/lib/BasePlugin.js\';\\n```\\n\\nInterested in creating your own plugin? Check out the\\n[\u201cwriting plugins\u201d](/docs/writing-plugins) guide.\\n\\n## Strict TypeScript types by default\\n\\nUppy used to have loose types by default and strict types as an opt-in. The\\ndefault export was a function that returned the `Uppy` class, and the types came\\nbundled with the default export (`Uppy.SomeType`).\\n\\n```ts\\nimport Uppy from \'@uppy/core\';\\nimport Tus from \'@uppy/tus\';\\n\\nconst uppy = Uppy<Uppy.StrictTypes>();\\n\\nuppy.use(Tus, {\\n\\tinvalidOption: null, // this will make the compilation fail!\\n});\\n```\\n\\nUppy is now strictly typed by default and loose types have been removed. The\\ndefault export is the `Uppy` class and not a function. This means you need to\\ncall `Uppy` with the `new` keyword when initializing it.\\n\\n```ts\\n// ...\\n\\nconst uppy = new Uppy();\\n\\nuppy.use(Tus, {\\n\\tinvalidOption: null, // this will make the compilation fail!\\n});\\n```\\n\\nUppy types are now individual exports and should be imported separately.\\n\\n\x3c!-- eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars --\x3e\\n\\n```ts\\nimport type { PluginOptions, UIPlugin, PluginTarget } from \'@uppy/core\';\\n```\\n\\n### Event types\\n\\n[`@uppy/core`][core] provides an [`.on`](/docs/uppy/#uppy-on-39-event-39-action)\\nmethod to listen to [events](/docs/uppy/#Events). The types for these events\\nwere loose and allowed for invalid events to be passed, such as\\n`uppy.on(\'upload-errrOOOoooOOOOOrrrr\')`.\\n\\nEvents have received a big update thanks to [@Hawxy](https://github.com/Hawxy),\\nmaking them more strict and accurate.\\n\\nA breaking change was required to make this happen:\\n\\n\x3c!-- eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars --\x3e\\n\\n```ts\\n// Before:\\n\\ntype Meta = { myCustomMetadata: string };\\n\\n// Invalid event\\nuppy.on<Meta>(\'upload-errrOOOoooOOOOOrrrr\', () => {\\n\\t// ...\\n});\\n\\n// After:\\n\\n// Normal event signature\\nuppy.on(\'complete\', (result) => {\\n\\tconst successResults = result.successful;\\n});\\n\\n// Custom signature\\ntype Meta = { myCustomMetadata: string };\\n\\n// Notice how the custom type has now become the second argument\\nuppy.on<\'complete\', Meta>(\'complete\', (result) => {\\n\\t// The passed type is now merged into the `meta` types.\\n\\tconst meta = result.successful[0].meta.myCustomMetadata;\\n});\\n```\\n\\nPlugins that add their own events can merge with existing ones in `@uppy/core`\\nwith `declare module \'@uppy/core\' { ... }`. This is a TypeScript pattern called\\n[module augmentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html#module-augmentation).\\nFor instance, when using [`@uppy/dashboard`][dashboard]:\\n\\n\x3c!-- eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars --\x3e\\n\\n```ts\\nuppy.on(\'dashboard:file-edit-start\', (file) => {\\n\\tconst fileName = file.name;\\n});\\n```\\n\\n## Batch pre-signing URLs for AWS S3 Multipart\\n\\nThe [`@uppy/aws-s3-multipart`][aws-s3-multipart] plugin can be used to upload\\nfiles directly to an S3 bucket using S3\u2019s Multipart upload strategy. With this\\nstrategy, files are chopped up in parts of 5MB+ each, so they can be uploaded\\nconcurrently. It is also very reliable: if a single part fails to upload, only\\nthat 5MB chunk has to be retried.\\n\\nHowever, in Uppy 1.0, every part had to make the trip to the server to generate\\na pre-signed URL. This meant that a 1GB file uploaded in 5MB chunks would\\nrequire two hundred trips to the server.\\n\\nAs of Uppy 2.0.0, we now pre-sign URLs in batches. That same 1GB file now only\\ntakes fifty trips to the server (if the limit was four).\\n\\nThis is now the new default. Thanks to\\n[@martin-brennan](https://github.com/martin-brennan) for this contribution!\\n\\nDo you care about reliable uploads? You could also consider [`@uppy/tus`][tus]\\nwith a self-hosted or Transloadit Tus server. Tus can resume uploads, supports\\nsmaller chunks, and offers increased upload speeds.\\n\\n## And more\\n\\n- The `.run` method on the `Uppy` instance has been removed. This method was\\n  already obsolete and only logged a warning. As of this major version, it no\\n  longer exists.\\n- [`@uppy/informer`][informer] now supports showing multiple notifications at\\n  the same time. The notifications themselves have also been improved.\\n- Improved screen reader accessibility for checkboxes and the \'remove file\'\\n  button for [`@uppy/dashboard`][dashboard].\\n- Sort files and folders alphabetically in the Google Drive provider.\\n- Polished our code base with improved eslint rules, private field methods, and\\n  other modern JavaScript features that help us write more intention-revealing\\n  and safe code.\\n- To make Uppy more friendly towards new contributors, we have renamed our\\n  `master` branch to `main`.\\n\\n## What future remains for 1.0?\\n\\nUppy 1.0 will continue to receive bug fixes for three more months (until\\n<time datetime=\\"2021-12-01\\">1 December 2021</time>), security fixes for one more\\nyear (until <time datetime=\\"2022-09-01\\">1 September 2022</time>), but no more\\nnew features after today. Exceptions are unlikely, but _can_ be made \u2013 to\\naccommodate those with commercial support contracts, for example.\\n\\n## That\'s it!\\n\\nWe hope you\'ll waste no time in taking Uppy 2.0 out for a walk. When you do,\\nplease let us know what you thought of it on\\n[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/penbr7/uppy_file_uploader_20_smaller_and_faster_modular/),\\n[HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28359287), ProductHunt, or\\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/uppy_io/status/1432399270846603264).

The drive on this release is mainly towards\\nfixing some terminology inconsistencies and aligning with Node.js LTS to ease\\nthe maintenance burden.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nSo what are the changes you can expect with Companion 2.0?\\n\\n## Node >= v10\\n\\nNode.js 8.x has reached end-of-life. Consequently, Companion 2.0 has dropped\\nsupport for Node.js 6.x and Node.js 8.x, and now requires that you run at least\\nNode.js 10.20.1.\\n\\n## Renamed provider options\\n\\nPre 2.0, there were inconsistencies in relation to the provider names. In some\\nplaces, the Google Drive provider was referred to as _google_ (e.g., in\\n`providerOptions`) while in some other places, it was referred to as _drive_\\n(e.g., the server endpoints `/drive/list`). Companion 2.0 now consistently uses\\nthe name _drive_ everywhere. Similarly, the OneDrive provider was made to have\\nthe consistent name _onedrive_.\\n\\n## Changed Redirect URIs\\n\\nOn the topic of consistent naming, we have also made some changes to the\\nredirect URIs supplied during the OAuth process. For example, in the case of\\nGoogle Drive, the form of the old redirect URI was\\n`https://mycompanionwebsite.tld/connect/google/callback`. In Companion 2.0, this\\nis now changed to `https://mycompanionwebsite.tld/drive/redirect`. This is a\\nBreaking Change: you will need to make the corresponding changes to your\\nredirect URIs on your Providers\' API Dashboards.\\n\\n## Compatibility with Uppy 1.x client\\n\\nCompanion 2.0 is compatible with any Uppy 1.x version, so you don\'t have to\\nworry about upgrading your Uppy client installations when you upgrade Companion\\non your server.\\n\\n## Will Companion v1 still receive updates?\\n\\nCompanion 1.x will continue to receive security patches until March 1, 2021.\\n\\n## Migrating from Companion 1.x to 2.x\\n\\nGiven the breaking changes, we\'ve created a\\n[migration tutorial for upgrading from Companion v1 to v2](https://uppy.io/docs/companion/#Migrating-v1-to-v2)."},{"id":"2020/07/1.18-image-editor","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2020/07/1.18-image-editor","editUrl":"https://github.com/transloadit/uppy.io/tree/main/blog/2020-07-1.18-image-editor.md","source":"@site/blog/2020-07-1.18-image-editor.md","title":"Image Editor \ud83c\udf08","description":"One of the most-requested Uppy features, the","date":"2020-07-21T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 21, 2020","tags":[],"readingTime":1.23,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"email":"artur@transloadit.com","name":"Artur Paikin","id":"artur","tagline":"Developer","imageURL":"https://github.com/arturi.png","key":"arturi"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Image Editor \ud83c\udf08","date":"2020-07-21T00:00:00.000Z","authors":["arturi"],"image":"https://uppy.io/img/blog/1.18-image-editor/image-editor-dashboard.jpg","published":true,"slug":"2020/07/1.18-image-editor"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Companion 2.0 is here","permalink":"/blog/2020/09/companion-2.0"},"nextItem":{"title":"Adding Custom Providers: Step by Step Tutorial to add Custom Providers","permalink":"/blog/2020/03/custom-providers"}},"content":"One of the most-requested Uppy features, the\\n[Image Editor](/docs/image-editor/), has landed (as beta) in 1.18.\\n\\n<video alt=\\"Demo video showing Uppy with Image Editor plugin \u2014 cropping, rotating and resizing images\\" poster=\\"https://uppy.io/img/blog/1.18-image-editor/image-editor-dashboard.jpg\\" muted autoplay loop>\\n  <source src=\\"/img/blog/1.18-image-editor/image-editor-demo.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n  Your browser does not support the video tag: https://uppy.io/img/blog/1.18-image-editor/image-editor-demo.mp4\\n</video>\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nThe editor currently supports cropping, resizing, rotating, flipping and zooming\\nyour images in and out.

Create a folder named \\"custom-provider\\" and navigate into it\\n\\n```sh\\nmkdir custom-provider\\ncd custom-provider\\n```\\n\\n2. Run `npm init` to setup your `package.json` file\\n3. install express, express-session, body-parser, request, uppy and\\n   @uppy/companion\\n\\n```sh\\nnpm i -S express express-session body-parser request @uppy/companion uppy\\n```\\n\\nwith all that done, my package.json file looks something like this:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n\\t\\"name\\": \\"custom-provider\\",\\n\\t\\"dependencies\\": {\\n\\t\\t\\"body-parser\\": \\"^1.18.2\\",\\n\\t\\t\\"express\\": \\"^4.16.2\\",\\n\\t\\t\\"express-session\\": \\"^1.15.6\\",\\n\\t\\t\\"request\\": \\"^2.88.0\\",\\n\\t\\t\\"uppy\\": \\"^1.16.1\\",\\n\\t\\t\\"@uppy/companion\\": \\"^2.0.0\\"\\n\\t},\\n\\t\\"private\\": true,\\n\\t\\"scripts\\": {}\\n}\\n```\\n\\n4. Create a `server/index.js` file within the project and add initiate your\\n   express server\\n\\n```js\\nconst express = require(\'express\');\\nconst companion = require(\'@uppy/companion\');\\nconst bodyParser = require(\'body-parser\');\\nconst session = require(\'express-session\');\\n\\nconst app = express();\\n\\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\\napp.use(\\n\\tsession({\\n\\t\\tsecret: \'some-secret\',\\n\\t\\tresave: true,\\n\\t\\tsaveUninitialized: true,\\n\\t}),\\n);\\n\\napp.use((req, res, next) => {\\n\\tres.setHeader(\'Access-Control-Allow-Origin\', req.headers.origin || \'*\');\\n\\tres.setHeader(\\n\\t\\t\'Access-Control-Allow-Methods\',\\n\\t\\t\'GET, POST, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, DELETE\',\\n\\t);\\n\\tres.setHeader(\\n\\t\\t\'Access-Control-Allow-Headers\',\\n\\t\\t\'Authorization, Origin, Content-Type, Accept\',\\n\\t);\\n\\tnext();\\n});\\n\\n// initialize uppy\\nconst companionOptions = {\\n\\tproviderOptions: {\\n\\t\\tdropbox: {\\n\\t\\t\\tkey: \'your Dropbox key\',\\n\\t\\t\\tsecret: \'your Dropbox secret\',\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t},\\n\\tserver: {\\n\\t\\thost: \'localhost:3020\',\\n\\t\\tprotocol: \'http\',\\n\\t},\\n\\tfilePath: \'./output\',\\n\\tsecret: \'some-secret\',\\n\\tdebug: true,\\n};\\n\\napp.use(companion.app(companionOptions));\\n\\n// handle 404\\napp.use((req, res, next) => {\\n\\treturn res.status(404).json({ message: \'Not Found\' });\\n});\\n\\ncompanion.socket(app.listen(3020));\\n\\nconsole.log(\'Welcome to Companion!\');\\nconsole.log(`Listening on http://0.0.0.0:3020`);\\n```\\n\\nThe code snippet above sets up an express server and plugs Companion into it.\\nHowever, the Companion setup doesn\'t include a custom provider yet. It only\\nincludes the Dropbox provider.\\n\\nTo be sure everything is working correctly so far, you can start the server by\\nrunning:\\n\\n`node server/index.js`\\n\\nIt should log the following message in the console:\\n\\n```sh\\nWelcome to Companion!\\nListening on http://0.0.0.0:3020\\n```\\n\\nNow we need to proceed to add our custom provider.\\n\\n### Setting up Unsplash API\\n\\nHead to Unsplash\'s [developer platform](https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications)\\n(you\'d need to create an account if you don\'t already have one).\\n\\nClick \\"New Application\\" to create a new application.

item.cover_photo.urls.thumb : item.urls.thumb,\\n      name: item.title || item.description,\\n      mimeType: isFolder ? null : \'image/jpeg\',\\n      id: item.id,\\n      thumbnail: isFolder ? item.cover_photo.urls.thumb : item.urls.thumb,\\n      requestPath: item.id,\\n      modifiedDate: item.updated_at,\\n      size: null\\n    })\\n  })\\n\\n  return data\\n}\\n```\\n\\nthe method makes an http request to the unsplash API based on the documentation\\nto [list collections](https://unsplash.com/documentation#list-collections) and\\n[list collection\'s photos](https://unsplash.com/documentation#get-a-collections-photos).\\nThe `_adaptData` method exists to help us conform to\\n[the list data](https://uppy.io/docs/companion/#list-data)\\n\\nOur `size` method will look something like this:\\n\\n```js\\nsize ({ id, token }, done) {\\n  const options = {\\n    url: `${BASE_URL}/photos/${id}`,\\n    method: \'GET\',\\n    json: true,\\n    headers: {\\n      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  request(options, (err, resp, body) => {\\n    if (err) {\\n      console.log(err)\\n      done(err)\\n      return\\n    }\\n\\n    done(null, body.width * body.height)\\n  })\\n}\\n```\\n\\nUnsplash\'s API doesn\'t provide the file size, so we are estimating it by\\nmultiplying the width and height of the image.\\n\\nThe `download` method will look like this:\\n\\n```js\\ndownload ({ id, token }, onData) {\\n  const options = {\\n    url: `${BASE_URL}/photos/${id}`,\\n    method: \'GET\',\\n    json: true,\\n    headers: {\\n      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  request(options, (err, resp, body) => {\\n    if (err) {\\n      console.log(err)\\n      return\\n    }\\n\\n    const url = body.links.download\\n    request.get(url)\\n      .on(\'data\', (chunk) => onData(null, chunk))\\n      .on(\'end\', () => onData(null, null))\\n      .on(\'error\', (err) => console.log(err))\\n  })\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWith all of this put together the entire file would look something like this:\\n\\n```js\\nconst request = require(\'request\');\\n\\nconst BASE_URL = \'https://api.unsplash.com\';\\n\\nclass MyCustomProvider {\\n\\tconstructor(options) {\\n\\t\\tthis.authProvider = \'myunsplash\';\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tlist({ token, directory }, done) {\\n\\t\\tconst path = directory ?

To do this we need to\\nimplement an Uppy Plugin.\\n\\nFirst, we\'ll create a `client/MyCustomProvider.js` file. Following the\\ninstructions [here](https://uppy.io/docs/writing-plugins/), our Uppy Plugin (aka\\n`client/MyCustomProvider.js` file) could look something like this:\\n\\n```js\\nconst { UIPlugin } = require(\'@uppy/core\');\\nconst { Provider } = require(\'@uppy/companion-client\');\\nconst { ProviderViews } = require(\'@uppy/provider-views\');\\nconst { h } = require(\'preact\');\\n\\nmodule.exports = class MyCustomProvider extends UIPlugin {\\n\\tconstructor(uppy, opts) {\\n\\t\\tsuper(uppy, opts);\\n\\t\\tthis.type = \'acquirer\';\\n\\t\\tthis.id = this.opts.id || \'MyCustomProvider\';\\n\\t\\tProvider.initPlugin(this, opts);\\n\\n\\t\\tthis.title = \'MyUnsplash\';\\n\\t\\tthis.icon = () => (\\n\\t\\t\\t<svg width=\\"32\\" height=\\"32\\" xmlns=\\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<path\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\td=\\"M10 9V0h12v9H10zm12 5h10v18H0V14h10v9h12v-9z\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfill=\\"#000000\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfill-rule=\\"nonzero\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t/>\\n\\t\\t\\t</svg>\\n\\t\\t);\\n\\n\\t\\tthis.provider = new Provider(uppy, {\\n\\t\\t\\tcompanionUrl: this.opts.companionUrl,\\n\\t\\t\\tcompanionHeaders: this.opts.companionHeaders,\\n\\t\\t\\tprovider: \'myunsplash\',\\n\\t\\t\\tpluginId: this.id,\\n\\t\\t});\\n\\n\\t\\tthis.files = [];\\n\\t\\tthis.onFirstRender = this.onFirstRender.bind(this);\\n\\t\\tthis.render = this.render.bind(this);\\n\\n\\t\\t// merge default options with the ones set by user\\n\\t\\tthis.opts = { ...opts };\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tinstall() {\\n\\t\\tthis.view = new ProviderViews(this, {\\n\\t\\t\\tprovider: this.provider,\\n\\t\\t});\\n\\n\\t\\tconst { target } = this.opts;\\n\\t\\tif (target) {\\n\\t\\t\\tthis.mount(target, this);\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tuninstall() {\\n\\t\\tthis.view.tearDown();\\n\\t\\tthis.unmount();\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tonFirstRender() {\\n\\t\\treturn this.view.getFolder();\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\trender(state) {\\n\\t\\treturn this.view.render(state);\\n\\t}\\n};\\n```\\n\\nAsides from implementing the methods required by the Uppy Plugin, we are also\\nimplmeneting the method `onFirstRender`. This is because we are using the\\n[@uppy/provider-views](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@uppy/provider-views)\\npackage to reuse its UI componenets. The\\n[@uppy/provider-views](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@uppy/provider-views)\\npackage requires that our plugin implements an `onFirstRender` method.\\n\\nWe are also pre-setting a default plugin with a default object structure which\\nis used by the `@uppy/provider-views` package.\\n\\nWith that done, we can now use our new plugin with Uppy. Create a file\\n`client/main.js` and initiate Uppy in there like so:\\n\\n```js\\nconst Uppy = require(\'@uppy/core\');\\nconst Dropbox = require(\'@uppy/dropbox\');\\nconst Tus = require(\'@uppy/tus\');\\nconst Dashboard = require(\'@uppy/dashboard\');\\nconst MyCustomProvider = require(\'./MyCustomProvider\');\\n\\nconst uppy = Uppy({\\n\\tdebug: true,\\n});\\n\\nuppy.use(Dropbox, {\\n\\tcompanionUrl: \'http://localhost:3020\',\\n});\\n\\nuppy.use(MyCustomProvider, {\\n\\tcompanionUrl: \'http://localhost:3020\',\\n});\\n\\nuppy.use(Dashboard, {\\n\\tinline: true,\\n\\ttarget: \'body\',\\n\\tplugins: [\'Dropbox\', \'MyCustomProvider\'],\\n});\\n\\nuppy.use(Tus, { endpoint: \'https://master.tus.io/files/\' });\\n```\\n\\nNow we need to bundle the file so it can be loaded on the browser. To do this,\\nwe\'d install [budo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/budo):\\n\\n1. In the root project directory, run `npm install budo -g`.\\n2. Create a `babel.config.js` file looking like so:\\n\\n```js\\nmodule.exports = (api) => {\\n\\tapi.env(\'test\');\\n\\treturn {\\n\\t\\tpresets: [\\n\\t\\t\\t[\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\'@babel/preset-env\',\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmodules: false,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tloose: true,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t},\\n\\t\\t\\t],\\n\\t\\t],\\n\\t\\tplugins: [[\'@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx\', { pragma: \'h\' }]].filter(\\n\\t\\t\\tBoolean,\\n\\t\\t),\\n\\t};\\n};\\n```\\n\\n3. Add an `index.html` file (in the root of the project) that uses a bundle file\\n   like so:\\n\\n```html\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\n<html>\\n\\t<head>\\n\\t\\t<meta charset=\\"utf-8\\" />\\n\\t\\t<meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\\" />\\n\\t\\t<title>Uppy Custom provider Example</title>\\n\\t\\t<link\\n\\t\\t\\thref=\\"https://releases.transloadit.com/uppy/v1.15.0/uppy.min.css\\"\\n\\t\\t\\trel=\\"stylesheet\\"\\n\\t\\t/>\\n\\t</head>\\n\\t<body>\\n\\t\\t<script src=\\"bundle.js\\"><\/script>\\n\\t</body>\\n</html>\\n```\\n\\n4. Create the bundle file by running\\n   `budo client/main.js:bundle.js -- -t babelify`. This will bundle your\\n   `client` side work and have it running on a local server. Please check the\\n   console log to see on what port the server is running. As at the time of this\\n   writing, it defaults to `9966` (URL will be http://localhost:9966/).\\n\\nYou can now load the URL of your client on your browser to see it running. When\\nI run mine, it looks something like this:\\n\\n![](/img/blog/custom-providers/dashboard-preview.png)\\n\\nIn order to use this with our Companion implementation, we need to also start\\nour Companion server by running `node server/index.js`.\\n\\nCongrats! \ud83c\udf89We have completed our custom plugin at this point. For an example\\nsource code on this tutorial, please see the\\n[custom provider example](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/tree/master/examples/custom-provider)."},{"id":"2020/04/1.13","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2020/04/1.13","editUrl":"https://github.com/transloadit/uppy.io/tree/main/blog/2020-04-1.13.md","source":"@site/blog/2020-04-1.13.md","title":"Uppy 1.11 \u2014 1.13: Dark Mode, custom meta fields and Google Docs in Companion","description":"Releases 1.11 through 1.13 introduced a bunch of major new features and","date":"2020-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 20, 2020","tags":[],"readingTime":2.725,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"email":"artur@transloadit.com","name":"Artur Paikin","id":"artur","tagline":"Developer","imageURL":"https://github.com/arturi.png","key":"arturi"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Uppy 1.11 \u2014 1.13: Dark Mode, custom meta fields and Google Docs in Companion","date":"2020-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","authors":["arturi"],"image":"https://uppy.io/img/blog/1.13/uppy-dashboard-dark-mar-2020.png","published":true,"slug":"2020/04/1.13"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Adding Custom Providers: Step by Step Tutorial to add Custom Providers","permalink":"/blog/2020/03/custom-providers"},"nextItem":{"title":"Uppy 1.10.1: Facebook and OneDrive","permalink":"/blog/2020/04/1.10"}},"content":"Releases 1.11 through 1.13 introduced a bunch of major new features and\\nbugfixes.

Thanks to @galli-leo, you can now add custom fields to the\\nDashboard meta editor, such as `<input type=\\"tel\\">`, `<select>` or\\n`<input type=\\"checkbox\\">`, like this:\\n\\n```js\\nuppy.use(Dashboard, {\\n\\ttrigger: \'#pick-files\',\\n\\tmetaFields: [\\n\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\tid: \'caption\',\\n\\t\\t\\tname: \'Caption\',\\n\\t\\t\\tplaceholder: \'describe what the image is about\',\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\tid: \'public\',\\n\\t\\t\\tname: \'Public\',\\n\\t\\t\\trender: ({ value, onChange }, h) => {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn h(\'input\', {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttype: \'checkbox\',\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tonChange: (ev) => onChange(ev.target.checked ? \'on\' : \'off\'),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdefaultChecked: value === \'on\',\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t});\\n\\t\\t\\t},\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t],\\n});\\n```\\n\\nSee [the docs](/docs/dashboard/#metaFields) and\\n[PR #2147](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/2147) for details.\\n\\n## Google Docs support in Companion\\n\\nIn the past, Uppy could already import files from Google Drive using Companion.\\nHowever, files from Google Docs are not _really_ files, and could not be\\nimported. That was confusing for users: some of their files simply didn\'t\\nappear!\\n\\nCompanion now automagically converts GSuite documents, such as docs,\\nspreadsheets and presentations, to `.docx`, `.xlsx` and `.ppt` files that can be\\nopened in various applications. The current list of conversions is hardcoded to:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n\\t\\"application/vnd.google-apps.document\\": \\".docx\\",\\n\\t\\"application/vnd.google-apps.drawing\\": \\".png\\",\\n\\t\\"application/vnd.google-apps.script\\": \\".json\\",\\n\\t\\"application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet\\": \\".xlsx\\",\\n\\t\\"application/vnd.google-apps.presentation\\": \\".ppt\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis may be configurable in a future release.\\n\\nNote that only documents under 10MB are converted. This is a limitation set by\\nthe Google Drive API.\\n\\n## AWS S3\\n\\nThe Aws S3 plugin now handles uploads internally, instead of deferring to XHR\\nUpload. This change fixes many bugs with Aws S3. See\\n[PR #2060](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/2147) for details.\\n\\n## Locales\\n\\nPolish, Croatian and Romanian language packs have been added by @alfatv, @dkisic\\nand @akizor :tada:\\n\\n## Exifr in Thumbnail Generator\\n\\n[@MikeKovarik](https://github.com/MikeKovarik) created an awesome library called\\n[Exifr](https://github.com/MikeKovarik/exifr), useful for extracting EXIF image\\ndata. He was kind enough to submit a PR that replaces Uppy\u2019s internal fork of\\n`exif-js` with `exifr`.

Here are the\\nhighlights:\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Companion: security patches and new Instagram API\\n\\n- We released a patch to an SSRF vulnerability affecting `@uppy/companion` and\\n  the `@uppy/url` plugin. Many thanks to the parties involved in\\n  [reporting and disclosing](https://hackerone.com/reports/786956) this\\n  vulnerability to the Uppy team. The patch is available in\\n  [@uppy/companion version 1.9.5](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#194).\\n- As the Instagram Legacy API will soon no longer be available, we have now\\n  added support for the new Instagram Graph API. As far as using this on\\n  `@uppy/companion` goes, not much has changed. The only difference is that you\\n  will now be retrieving your Instagram credentials from the\\n  [Facebook Developer Platform](https://developers.facebook.com/), and no longer\\n  from the [Instagram Developer Platform](https://www.instagram.com/developer/).\\n\\n## Error handling\\n\\n- We\u2019ve significantly improved error handling and retries in `@uppy/core`,\\n  `@uppy/transloadit` and `@uppy/dashboard`. The retry button on the Status Bar,\\n  which was broken in some edge cases, now works as expected.\\n- Errors from Transloadit assemblies now include Assembly ID, as well as the\\n  full assembly object, for easier debugging.\\n- You can now click on the question mark (?) icon on the Informer or Dashboard\\n  error message, and get a browser alert with error details \u2014 much easier for\\n  the users to copy-paste the text this way. The Informer now also conveniently\\n  stays on screen, as long as you hover over the question mark.\\n\\n## Dashboard\\n\\nThe Dashboard plugin has gained new file type icons: for images \u2014 useful before\\nthe preview is generated, or when there\u2019s no preview at all, like with images\\nfrom the Url plugin \u2014 and for archives.\\n\\n![](/img/blog/1.9/file-type-icons.png)\\n\\n## Types\\n\\nOur typings got a significant upgrade: plugin options can now be type-checked!\\nIn the past, we did have typings for plugin options, but the `uppy.use()`\\nfunction had a fallback that would accept _any_ object as options. If your\\nplugin options were wrong, typescript would just use the fallback and not tell\\nyou about it!\\n\\nStricter typings normally mean that old code may no longer type-check. So,\\nalthough this is a bugfix, you have to opt into the new types. In 2.0, the old\\nway will be removed and only the strict types will be available.\\n\\nYou can opt in by specifying the `StrictTypes` type parameter to the `Uppy`\\ntype:\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport Uppy = require(\'@uppy/core\');\\nconst uppy = Uppy<Uppy.StrictTypes>({\\n\\t// options here\\n});\\n```\\n\\nThis type parameter must also be specified if you are storing the `uppy`\\ninstance anywhere. For example, inside a class:\\n\\n```typescript\\nclass UppyProvider extends React.Component {\\n\\tprivate uppy: Uppy<Uppy.StrictTypes>;\\n\\tconstructor(props) {\\n\\t\\tsuper(props);\\n\\t\\tthis.uppy = Uppy<Uppy.StrictTypes>({\\n\\t\\t\\t// etc\\n\\t\\t});\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIf you do not specify the `StrictTypes` parameter, the old fallback for the\\n`uppy.use()` method remains available.\\n\\nThe typings for `@uppy/react` component props are now derived from plugin\\noptions types, so they will no longer get out of sync, as they occasionally did\\nin the past. For example, in version 1.7, the `@uppy/drag-drop` plugin supported\\na `note` option to add some text to the drop area. The React typings didn\'t\\ninclude that option, so you couldn\'t use it from typescript! That is now\\npermanently fixed:\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport components = require(\'@uppy/react\');\\nconst { DragDrop } = components;\\n\\n// assuming some `uppy` variable already exists\\ndeclare var uppy: Uppy<Uppy.StrictTypes>;\\n\\nfunction MyComponent() {\\n\\treturn <DragDrop uppy={uppy} note=\\"This prop is now supported!\\" />;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nFinally, the `locale` options and React props now have full typings. Your editor\\nshould now be able to provide autocompletion for language keys!\\n\\n![Screenshot showing VS Code autocompletion for a language key.](/img/blog/1.9/locale-type.png)\\n\\nWe now also use `tsd`, so our typings are actually tested.\\n\\nSee [PR #1918](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1918) for all the\\ndetails.\\n\\n## Downloadable ZIP archives of Uppy releases\\n\\nUppy is now available as a downloadable ZIP archive from the Transloadit CDN!\\nNPM down?

The locale names follow\\na `country_LANGUAGE` format. Previously, we used `es_GL` for Galician, which was\\nintended to mean \u201cGalician in Spain\u201d, but which _actually_ means \u201cSpanish in\\nGreenland\u201d! The correct way to refer to Galician is as `gl_ES`:\\n\\n```js\\nrequire(\'@uppy/locales/lib/gl_ES\');\\n```\\n\\nThe old `es_GL` name is now an alias for `gl_ES`. It will be removed in a future\\nmajor release, so we recommend updating your code if you were using the old\\nname. If you do it now, the migration will be easier once 2.0 comes around\\n:smile:\\n\\n## Misc\\n\\n- @uppy/aws-s3: add some tests (@bambii7, #1934)\\n- @uppy/companion: add onedrive domain validation for the demo deployment\\n  (@ifedapoolarewaju, #1959)\\n- @uppy/companion: change demo deployment type to stable API (@kiloreux, #1938)\\n- @uppy/companion: rename uppy occurrences to companion (@ifedapoolarewaju,\\n  #1926)\\n- @uppy/companion: upgrade `helmet` (@goto-bus-stop,\\n  [6b006ac](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/commit/6b006ac42c20062c37bdcaf6a77e07b304da7957))\\n- @uppy/core: make `uppy.on()` work better with IntelliSense (@bambii7, #1923)\\n- @uppy/dashboard: hide top bar cancel button when `hideCancelButton: true`\\n  (@goto-bus-stop, #1955)\\n- @uppy/thumbnail-generator: add webp to the list of supported types (@arturi,\\n  #1961)\\n- @uppy/thumbnail-generator: vendor exif-js source in Uppy (@mskelton, #1940)\\n- docs: FB and OneDrive are not yet in the CDN bundle (@goto-bus-stop,\\n  [61b54b9](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/commit/61b54b914dd437d2e60362c4ece1429943b32555))\\n- docs: add `companionHeaders` to s3-multipart docs (@goto-bus-stop,\\n  [a6e44a9](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/commit/a6e44a953114e385466dcce884d37e433f030549))\\n- docs: add reset-progress event to docs (@bambii7, #1922)\\n- docs: make Robodog naming more consistent (@goto-bus-stop, #1935)\\n- docs: make react sample code more standalone (@uxitten, #1864)\\n- examples: remove `UPPYSERVER_` references (@goto-bus-stop,\\n  [e74690e](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/commit/e74690e20cc0a1afd9156ce03b1ca6a5358cc7d9))\\n- website: add facebook to dashboard example (@ifedapoolarewaju, #1930)\\n- website: add plugin versions (@arturi, #1952)\\n- website: enable onedrive on the website example (@ifedapoolarewaju, #1975)\\n\\nAs always, you can find the full list of changes and package versions, as well\\nas future plans, in our\\n[changelog](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)."},{"id":"2019/11/1.6","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2019/11/1.6","editUrl":"https://github.com/transloadit/uppy.io/tree/main/blog/2019-11-1.6.md","source":"@site/blog/2019-11-1.6.md","title":"Uppy 1.6: setOptions(), Icelandic and Thai","description":"This release adds a long-awaited uppy.setOptions() API, allowing you to update","date":"2019-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 13, 2019","tags":[],"readingTime":1.71,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"email":"artur@transloadit.com","name":"Artur Paikin","id":"artur","tagline":"Developer","imageURL":"https://github.com/arturi.png","key":"arturi"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Uppy 1.6: setOptions(), Icelandic and Thai","date":"2019-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","authors":["arturi"],"published":true,"slug":"2019/11/1.6"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Uppy 1.7: A Small One","permalink":"/blog/2019/12/1.7"},"nextItem":{"title":"Uppy 1.5: Facebook and OneDrive (beta) support, upload cancellation","permalink":"/blog/2019/10/1.5"}},"content":"This release adds a long-awaited `uppy.setOptions()` API, allowing you to update\\noptions of Uppy and its plugins on the fly.

We are adding the `file.meta.relativePath` to `file.id`. `relativePath`\\n   exists on files that have been dropped together with a folder. This means\\n   that if you drop a folder with `folder/a.jpg` and `folder/subfolder/a.jpg`,\\n   both `a.jpg`s will be added, since they come from different folders and this\\n   kind of duplication might be intended.\\n\\nSee PR [#1767](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1767) for details.\\n\\n## Dashboard\\n\\nFiles in the Dashboard no longer have an icon indicating where they came from\\n(local device, GDrive, etc.). We think it\'s nice for developers to see, but not\\nthat useful for most end users. If you want to re-enable it, you can add the\\nfollowing CSS to your app:\\n\\n```css\\n.uppy-DashboardItem-sourceIcon {\\n\\tdisplay: inline-block;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe difference is very small. The icons used to be next to the file size, as\\nseen here in Uppy v1.3:\\n![Uppy Dashboard v1.3, with file source icon](/img/blog/1.5/with-source-icon.png)\\n\\nNow, in v1.5, they\u2019re gone:\\n![Uppy Dashboard v1.5, without file source icon](/img/blog/1.5/without-source-icon.png)\\n\\nAdditionally:\\n\\n- Editing a file now fires `dashboard:file-edit-start` and\\n  `dashboard:file-edit-complete` events\\n  ([#1776](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1776))\\n- Excessive debug logging is reduced\\n  ([#1747](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1747))\\n- Fixes to the TypeScript typings were submitted by @mrbatista and\\n  @MatthiasKunnen\\n\\n## Cancellation\\n\\nOur old approach to limiting the amount of simultaneous uploads had some\\nproblems. Uploads were queued by chaining Promises, but they did not respect\\ncancellation. So, if you cancelled an upload while some files were still waiting\\nto start, those files would actually start uploading even though they had\\nalready been removed. Obviously, that\'s pretty bad!\\n\\nPR [#1736](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1736) addresses this by\\nripping out the old limiting code and replacing it with a new,\\ncancellation-aware upload queue. We\u2019ve also added a browser test to make sure\\nthat this thing stays resilient:\\n\\n<video alt=\\"Demo video showing an automated Chaos Monkey session with Uppy\\" muted autoplay loop>\\n  <source src=\\"/img/blog/1.5/chaos-monkey.webm\\" type=\\"video/webm\\" />\\n  <source src=\\"/img/blog/1.5/chaos-monkey.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n## Lerna lerna lerna\\n\\nIn August, we bit the bullet and used Lerna\u2019s `lerna link convert` feature. Now,\\nall the packages in our monorepo depend on each other, using\\n`file:../packagename/` paths instead of version numbers. The entire repository\\nis one big dependency tree in npm\'s view. Npm can install the entire thing on\\nits own, without `lerna bootstrap`\u2019s help! Since npm manages the entire tree,\\nthe `package-lock.json` file in the repository root contains everything we need.\\nWe can now use the faster `npm ci` install command on CI, saving more than sixty\\nseconds on every run :tada:\\n\\nAs part of this effort, we also added all our examples to the lerna-managed\\ntree, so you no longer have to do `npm install` in example folders to use them.\\n\\nThis change makes working on the repository much easier, since dependencies are\\nhandled in the same way as in any other repository, simply by doing:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install\\n```\\n\\n## Localization\\n\\nThanks to multiple contributors, Uppy now knows Czech, Danish, Greek,\\nIndonesian, and Swedish, on top of the nineteen languages that were already\\nsupported! The Serbian locale is now available in both the Cyrillic and Latin\\nscripts. Big thanks to @achmiral, @arggh, @czj, @jukakoski, @marcusforberg,\\n@nndevstudio, @Pzoco, @Tashows, and @tvaliasek for their efforts \u2728\\n\\nNew translations are rolling in every month, but there are plenty more languages\\nout there that Uppy would love to learn. Please consider\\n[contributing your language](/docs/locales/#Contributing-a-new-language) as\\nwell!\\n\\n## Facebook and OneDrive\\n\\nThis release adds two experimental new remote providers: Facebook and OneDrive.\\nFor now, they are not available through the `uppy` package. To use them, install\\n`@uppy/facebook` or `@uppy/onedrive`:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install @uppy/facebook\\nnpm install @uppy/onedrive\\n```\\n\\nConfigure Companion to access the Facebook and OneDrive APIs, using environment\\nvariables or the JS API:\\n\\n```bash\\nexport COMPANION_FACEBOOK_KEY=\\"***\\"\\nexport COMPANION_FACEBOOK_SECRET=\\"***\\"\\nexport COMPANION_ONEDRIVE_KEY=\\"***\\"\\nexport COMPANION_ONEDRIVE_SECRET=\\"***\\"\\n```\\n\\n```js\\nproviderOptions: {\\n  facebook: {\\n    key: \'\',\\n    secret: \'\'\\n  },\\n  // For OneDrive\u2019s key & secret pair, please use `microsoft` option key\\n  microsoft: {\\n    key: \'\',\\n    secret: \'\'\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThen use them like the existing providers:\\n\\n```js\\nconst Facebook = require(\'@uppy/facebook\');\\nconst OneDrive = require(\'@uppy/onedrive\');\\n\\nuppy.use(Facebook, { companionUrl: YOUR_COMPANION_URL });\\nuppy.use(OneDrive, { companionUrl: YOUR_COMPANION_URL });\\n```\\n\\nWe\u2019re still waiting for our developer keys to be approved, so we don\'t have\\nworking examples on the website yet! We\u2019ll let you know on\\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/uppy_io) when they\u2019re live.\\n\\nOnce these new providers have been tested for a while, we will release them as\\n1.0 and include them in the main Uppy and Robodog bundles.\\n\\n## Revoke Companion\u2019s Provider access on logout\\n\\nUp until now, when users clicked \u201clogout\u201d after using a remote Provider, such as\\nGoogle Drive or Dropbox, Uppy would destroy the access token. But on the\\nProvider\u2019s side, Uppy was still allowed access. Should the user click \u201cConnect\\nto Google Drive\u201d again, no extra confirmation was required.\\n\\nAfter a discussion in [#1563](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/1563),\\nwe are expanding the logout process. Now, when users log out of remote Providers\\nthrough Uppy, Companion will destroy the token as before, but also attempt to\\nrevoke the access from the corresponding Provider. In the event that the\\nProvider doesn\u2019t support access revoke via it\u2019s API, Uppy will display a helpful\\nmessage informing users how they can revoke the permissions manually.\\n\\nSee [#1843](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1843) for details.\\n\\n## Misc\\n\\n- @uppy/aws-s3-multipart: fix queueing behaviors, especially interaction with\\n  cancellation (@goto-bus-stop, #1855)\\n- @uppy/aws-s3: replace browser-only resolve-url by isomorphic url-parse\\n  (@goto-bus-stop, #1854)\\n- @uppy/companion-client: rename serverHeaders to companionHeaders\\n  (@goto-bus-stop, #1861)\\n- @uppy/companion: Fix S3 uploads for URL plugins (#1784 / @@ifedapoolarewaju)\\n- @uppy/companion: bump lodash.merge to 4.6.2 to fix audit warning (#1796 /\\n  @rettgerst)\\n- @uppy/companion: set allowed HTTP methods internally (#1754 /\\n  @ifedapoolarewaju)\\n- @uppy/companion: whenever an error is returned from Companion: the auth screen\\n  will be displayed if the user was never authenticated; if the user is\\n  authenticated, the last screen on display before the error will be displayed\\n  (#1743 / @ifedapoolarewaju)\\n- @uppy/core: Made sure we can upload new files if we cancel last file\\n  (allowMultipleUploads: false) (#1764 / @lakesare)\\n- @uppy/core: fix \\"Cannot read property \'log\' of undefined\\" (#1785 / @theJoeBiz)\\n- @uppy/core: use setFileState inside retryUpload (#1759 / @goto-bus-stop)\\n- @uppy/dashboard, @uppy/drag-drop: getDroppedFiles.js: handle exceptions better\\n  (#1797 / @lakesare)\\n- @uppy/form: try/catch parsing, set updatedResult to an empty array when not an\\n  array (#1800 / @arturi)\\n- @uppy/locales: Finnish semantics improved and fixed some typos (#1744 /\\n  @jukakoski)\\n- @uppy/locales: Update sr_RS_Latin.js (#1749 / @nndevstudio)\\n- @uppy/locales: correct some fr_FR localization strings (#1807 / @czj)\\n- @uppy/locales: fix typo in Persian locale (@uxitten, #1865)\\n- @uppy/locales: improve Swedish translation (@marcusforberg, #1859)\\n- @uppy/thumbnail-generator: add waitForThumbnailsBeforeUpload option, false by\\n  default (@arturi, #1803)\\n- @uppy/transloadit: add limit option, warn about using limit when it\u2019s set\\n  to 0.

We are back after a period of silence following the\\n[Uppy 1.0 release](https://uppy.io/blog/2019/04/1.0/) in the end of April. It\\nwas pretty well received by the commnunity and press: we hit the front pages of\\nHacker News, [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/uppy-1-0/) and\\n[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/bhkx5k/uppy_10_your_best_friend_in_file_uploading/).\\nWe then started trending and gained over 20,000 stargazers on GitHub, got\\nmentioned by\\n[Smashing Magazine](https://mobile.twitter.com/smashingmag/status/1097870169043546112),\\n[JavaScript Daily](https://twitter.com/JavaScriptDaily/status/1122935583603556352)\\nand [JavaScript Weekly](https://javascriptweekly.com/issues/434). It\u2019s been a\\ncrazy ride! We\u2019d like to thank all our contributors and users for their\\ncontinued support.\\n\\nIt was not all self reflection and celebrations, though, in Uppy Remote\\nHeadquaters\u2122 following the `1.0` launch. After some vacation time, we quickly\\ngot back to work, releasing Uppy `1.1`, `1.2` and `1.3`. These updates address a\\nlot of issues raised by the community and the team.\\n\\nThis post highlights the most important and exciting changes from those\\nreleases: accessibility and performance, thumbnails rotatation, new logger,\\nprogress and uploader improvements, Robodog and Companion updates, new languages\\nand more.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Accessibility\\n\\nOur new team member, Evgenia, has been on a roll and together with Artur and\\nAlex, she has been working hard on improving accessiblity in Uppy. Evgenia has\\ncome up with something called \u201csuperfocus\u201d, which makes sure focus stays on the\\nmost relevant button or field in the current view. The `@uppy/provider-views`\\nlayouts have been refactored so that checkboxes and labels are accessible. Focus\\nstyles have also been improved.\\n\\n<video alt=\\"Demo video showing Uppy focus management in action\\" muted autoplay loop>\\n  <source src=\\"/img/blog/1.3/uppy-focus-demo.webm\\" type=\\"video/webm\\" />\\n  <source src=\\"/img/blog/1.3/uppy-focus-demo.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\nOther notable accessiblity fixes and improvements:\\n\\n- An \u201cAdd more\u201d caption near the + button has been added to the desktop version\\n  of Uppy\\n- \u201cCopy link\u201d & \u201cEdit\u201d links have been replaced with icons\\n- All SVGs are now not focusable in IE11\\n- Pasting works while we\u2019re focused on buttons\\n- Focus is not lost when state is updated in filter in provider-views or when\\n  editing file meta\\n- Selected checkboxes now persist when moving between folders\\n\\n\u26a0\ufe0f `@uppy/provider-views` translation strings have been moved from Dashboard to\\nCore. This eliminates a dependency of provider-views upon Dashboard\\n[#1712](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1712).\\n\\nSee [#1507](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1507),\\n[#1574](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1574) and\\n[#1656](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1656) for more details.\\n\\n## Dashboard performance improvements\\n\\nRen\xe9e attacked performance problems in the Dashboard when adding many hundreds\\nof files. Previously, we naively rerendered the entire file list when _any_ file\\nhad a change. Now, only the changed file rerenders:\\n\\nBefore:\\n\\n![slow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1006268/59605307-ce67f580-910e-11e9-992a-6e0c3c2a7570.gif)\\n\\nAfter:\\n\\n![fast](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1006268/59605354-e3dd1f80-910e-11e9-9cb3-1b7339650959.gif)\\n\\nSee [#1671](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1671) for more details. As\\nyou can see, there are still some laggy interactions \u2014 expect more improvements\\nin future releases!\\n\\n## Logger\\n\\nWe\u2019ve added an option to supply a `logger` object with `debug`, `warn` and\\n`error` methods, so you can use a custom logging solution with Uppy. Check out\\n[the docs](https://uppy.io/docs/uppy/#logger) for more information.\\n\\nIn the future, past 2.0, the `logger: Uppy.debugLogger` option is going to\\nreplace `debug: true`. The latter will be kept for backwards compatibility for\\nnow.\\n\\n\u26a0\ufe0f Since `@uppy/core@1.2`, the default logger has switched to `console.debug`\\nfrom `console.log` by default. You might need to change settings in your\\nbrowser\u2019s devtools to see Uppy logs!\\n\\nVersions of each Uppy plugin and Core are now also logged for easier debugging.\\n\\nSee [#1661](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1661) and\\n[#1640](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1640) for more details.\\n\\n## Thumbnails rotated correctly\\n\\nBefore this change, when you added a file to Uppy from a mobile device, you\\nwould sometimes see the preview image sideways. This was because we didn\u2019t\\naccount for EXIF rotation metadata when generating thumbnails with\\n`@uppy/thumbnail-generator`. But now, thanks to\\n[@Botz](https://github.com/Botz), we do! See\\n[#1532](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1661).\\n\\n## Progress improvements\\n\\n- The Status Bar now shows the correct total size of the upload when some files\\n  have already finished, instead of jumping down\\n  [#1685](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1685).\\n- Fixed an issue where progress could jump to bizarrely high values (like 1038%)\\n  while uploading files that don\u2019t have a known size (e.g., pictures from\\n  Instagram) [#1610](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1610).\\n- We\u2019ve moved from the `prettier-bytes` package into `@uppy/utils`, and divide\\n  by `1024` instead of `1000` to justify `KB` vs `kB`\\n  [#1732](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1732).\\n\\n## Drag and drop\\n\\n- Drag and drop has been refactored internally in both the Dashboard and\\n  DragDrop plugins. This means a more robust and cross-browser implementation,\\n  with a fancy \u201cdrop files here\u201d screen when you drag over the Dashboard.\\n- The `@uppy/drag-drop` plugin now renders an entirely clickable DnD area.\\n\\n![](/img/blog/1.3/drag-drop-focus.png)\\n\\nSee [#1440](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1440),\\n[#1565](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1565) and\\n[#1633](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1633) for more details.\\n\\n## Uploaders\\n\\n- xhr-upload: we now send along global metadata when `bundle: true` option is\\n  set [#1677](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1677).\\n- xhr-upload: type and name are set from file.meta\\n  [#1616](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1616).\\n- aws-s3-multipart: added metadata support for S3 MultiPart\\n  [#1698](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1698).\\n- aws-s3: allows overriding of getResponseData()\\n  [#1647](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1647).\\n- aws-s3: prevents unnecessary delete multiparts request for completed files\\n  [#1650](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1650).\\n- aws-s3: do not extract keys from empty `fields`\\n  [#1569](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1569).\\n- tus: `metaFields` option has been added to the tus plugin\\n  [#1644](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1644).\\n\\n## Localization\\n\\nThanks to our amazing contributors, Uppy now speaks: Arabic, Chinese, Dutch,\\nEnglish, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Persian,\\nPortuguese, Russian, Serbian, Spanish an Turkish!\\n\\nNew translations are rolling in every month, but there are plenty more languages\\nout there that Uppy would love to learn. Please consider\\n[contributing your language](http://uppy.io/docs/locales/#Contributing-a-new-language)\\nas well!\\n\\nWe\u2019ve also added docs for locales \u2014 how to use from NPM and CDN, auto-generated\\nlist of languages that are supported already and an invitation to add more\\n[#1553](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1553).\\n\\nFinally, we\u2019ve fixed an issue that could occur when adding files with names in\\nnon-Latin alphabets. When adding a file to Uppy, it gets an ID based on several\\ncharacteristics, such as its size and file name. Previously, our ID generation\\nwould ignore any non-alphanumeric characters in the file name, which could cause\\nthe IDs for different files to clash. Now, those characters are worked into the\\nID, so that multiple similar files with different non-alphanumeric names can be\\nadded. See [#1722](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1722).\\n\\n## Robodog\\n\\nRobodog is an Uppy-based library that helps you talk to the Transloadit API.\\nSince 1.0, most of the updates have been bugfixes:\\n\\n- `Robodog.dashboard()` and `Robodog.form()` now pass their options to the\\n  `@uppy/dashboard` plugin as advertised.\\n- `Robodog.form()` now supports the `triggerUploadOnSubmit` option from\\n  `@uppy/form`.\\n- `Robodog.form()` now supports localization of the \u201cChoose files\u201d button it\\n  adds in the default configuration.\\n\\n## Build\\n\\n- Ren\xe9e split our test runs into multiple jobs on Travis CI, so unit tests,\\n  end-to-end tests and other jobs all run in parallel. This lets us identify\\n  issues with failing builds quicker and also slashes total build times by half!\\n  \ud83d\ude80 [#1709](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1709).\\n- Webdriverio, which we use for end-to-end testing, has been updated to v5.

They\\nposted a [job ad](https://transloadit.com/jobs/2015-10-front-end-developer/) in\\nsearch for people to build it:\\n\\n> In general, we\u2019re looking for polished, well tested, carefully crafted\\n> products that are delightful to work with and use. So for this job it\u2019s not\\n> only important that you know JavaScript, but also how to make things look\\n> stunning and work well for end users.\\n>\\n> At your disposal are time, focus, and the core team ready to provide feedback,\\n> guidance, and anything else you need.\\n\\nShortly after, I saw a retweet of this vacancy come across my time line and I\\ndecided to apply. That, in a nutshell, is how I got involved with Uppy in the\\nearliest stages of the project.\\n\\nInitially, the idea was to build a proprietary uploader that would work\\nexclusively with Transloadit\u2019s commercial service, but we quickly turned around\\non it. We felt our version of a file uploader could have a real impact if we\\nmade it more widely available. So, just like Transloadit had done before with\\n[Tus](https://tus.io/), we decided to make Uppy an open source solution \u2014 free\\nfor anyone to use and hack on. Transloadit support became an optional plugin.\\n\\nThree years,\\n[16.000 stargazers](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/stargazers), getting\\nfeatured on\\n[Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-newsletter/smashing-newsletter-issue-197/),\\n[JavaScript Daily](https://twitter.com/JavaScriptDaily/status/950348390268919809),\\n[Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/uppy-io), and\\n[SurviveJS](https://survivejs.com/blog/uppy-interview/), and a thriving\\ncommunity later\xa0\u2014 and we could not be happier to finally launch Uppy 1.0!\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Why build Uppy in the first place?\\n\\nWe occasionally get asked why we would even need anything beyond\\n`<input type=\\"file\\">`. Why bring JS into this at all? The truth is, for many\\ncases, `<input type=\\"file\\">` is fine.\\n\\nSometimes, however, you might like to add a drag-and-drop surface with file\\npreviews or upload progress reporting that works well across browsers. Webcam\\nsupport could be useful. Other than that, picking files directly from your\\nInstagram and Dropbox \u2014 without first passing through your mobile phone \u2014 can\\nsave a lot of bandwidth and battery life (uploads with Uppy and Companion happen\\nserver-to-server). In all those cases, you\u2019ll need something more than a simple\\n`<input type=\\"file\\">` tag.\\n\\n<center><iframe style={{border: \\"none\\"}} src=\\"https://cards.producthunt.com/cards/posts/152565?v=1\\" width=\\"598\\" height=\\"405\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" scrolling=\\"no\\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>\\n\\nThen there\u2019s also the issue of large files, where resumability is essential.\\nIt\u2019s basically unacceptable in this day and age to still have to restart your\\nupload from scratch, just because your WiFi had a hiccup. That\u2019s why Uppy uses\\nTus, the open protocol for resumable file uploading.\\n\\nAll these things significantly improve the user experience to the point where\\nmore files actually make it to your platform, and less users rage-quit and close\\nthe tab. These things become important when uploading is a central aspect of\\nyour website or app. Uppy can also be deployed with nothing but a JS tag, using\\nan existing `<form>` for fallback (to support IE6! :smile:), and your\\nApache/Nginx server.\\n\\n## Building a team to create Uppy\\n\\nThe Uppy team first consisted of [myself](https://github.com/arturi) and\\n[Harry](https://github.com/hedgerh). Since I moved to New York for a while, with\\nmost of the team based in Europe, we got used to having some very early (or\\nlate) calls with significant time differences.\\n\\nI was mostly working on the frontend and building what is known today as the\\n[Dashboard](/examples/dashboard/) \u2014 the fully-featured and most commonly used\\nUppy plugin. Harry took on the first version of what was then called Uppy Server\\n(now Companion) \u2014 responsible for picking files from Google Drive, Instagram,\\nremote Urls, etc.\\n\\nIn 2016, the Transloadit team had a meetup in Amsterdam, where I ended up being\\n[present](https://mobile.twitter.com/arturi/status/701394760796229632) in a most\\nunusual way (in the center):\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/blog/1.0/amsterdam-team-meetup.jpg\\" />\\n\\nLater that year, [Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju) joined the Uppy team\\nas well and took over all Companion work.\\n\\nBuilding all of the intended Uppy features properly took a lot of time. So, two\\nyears after landing the project at Transloadit, I was\\n[writing a job ad post myself](https://transloadit.com/jobs/2017-02-open-source-frontend-dev/)\\nas Uppy was starting to take on serious proportions. That\u2019s where\\n[Ren\xe9e](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop) joined the team (funny story \u2014 we met\\nthrough collaborating on GitHub on Choo and Yo-Yo libraries) to help us with\\nUppy React components, Redux integration, the Golden Retriever plugin and many\\nmore cool features.\\n\\nAround that time, [Alex](https://zaytsev.io/) also joined in to advise us on the\\nUI design, completing the Uppy team as it still stands today.\\n\\nIn the summer of 2017, the Transloadit team had another meeting. This time in\\nBerlin, where we worked on the [Golden Retriever](/docs/golden-retriever/)\\nplugin that helps recover files after browser crashes. We also played Mario Kart\\n(I lost, despite all the practice!) and dressed up as characters from the game:\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/blog/1.0/uppy-team-kong.jpg\\" />\\n\\nRead more\\n[about Golden Retriever and that team meetup](https://uppy.io/blog/2017/07/golden-retriever/).\\nGolden Retriever got good press on Reddit and Hacker News because it goes above\\nand beyond to make things absurdly reliable. In the demo video, you see us\\n`kill -9` our browser, restart, and the upload just picks right up where it left\\noff. A first!\\n\\n## Challenge accepted: only 30 days to liftoff\\n\\nWe had been postponing the 1.0 release for quite some time. There\u2019s always just\\none more feature you\u2019d like to add or another bug you want to fix, before\\ncalling something ready for a 1.0 release. Truth be told, Uppy has been\\n[used in production](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy#used-by) for a while\\nalready, and even though we iterate and change things frequently, the API had\\nmostly stabilized.\\n\\nSo, about a month ago, we decided to pull the trigger and\\n[announced an Uppy Month](https://uppy.io/blog/2019/03/liftoff-01/) within\\nTransloadit. This meant that all team members, including those not working\\nprimarily on Uppy \u2014 the Tus core team, our SDK teams, as well as our infra and\\nAPI engineers, designers, content writers, and the founders themselves \u2014 all\\nchipped in and did their part to ensure liftoff in thirty days. We also asked\\n[Evgenia](http://github.com/lakesare) to join us for the month to lend a hand\\nwith frontend work. Every week, we had a call where we looked at the Uppy 1.0\\nproject board and talked about our progress:\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/blog/30daystoliftoff/15-dashboard.png\\" />\\n\\nHere are some highlights of what we\u2019ve managed to deliver during one month of\\nEverything Uppy:\\n\\n- A new Uppy website design.\\n- [Localization support and language packs](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1443)\\n  for Russian, German, Dutch and French (with more coming from the community).\\n  [Kevin](https://github.com/kvz) and I wrote a script that loops through all\\n  Uppy plugins in the repo and generates one canonical `en_US` that can be used\\n  as a basis for other translations. The script even checks for missing strings\\n  accross all translations, so you know which ones to update.\\n- [Drag and Drop in the Dashboard](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1440),\\n  being an important part of Uppy, has been significantly improved with support\\n  for pasting files and links from both the browser and the device. So you can\\n  now, say, drag a link or an image from a different tab to Uppy!\\n- [Basic React Native support (Beta)](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/988):\\n  Uppy runs in a React Native environment, we have an example with resumable\\n  uploads via tus, and `@uppy/react-native` Expo-component support for picking\\n  images, videos, documents, and files from remote URLs with the help of\\n  Companion.\\n- [Design facelift](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1442): the\\n  Dashboard UI has been significantly improved in the past days: new icons have\\n  been added, as well as typography polishing, better color organization,\\n  enlarged clickable areas, and more.\\n- Many accessibility issues uncovered.\\n- [Robodog gained support for an inline Dashboard](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1450).\\n- [The documentation structure has been reworked](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1405).\\n- [Transloadit Assemblies can now be properly canceled](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1431).\\n- [Upload progress is reported more accurately with XHR-upload and Companion](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1454).\\n- [Upload progress is improved in general](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1376).\\n- [npm scripts have been refactored](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1392)\\n  \u2014 yes, that\u2019s important!\\n- And craziest of all: our content team has been on a roll and\\n  [released a post _every day_](https://uppy.io/blog/2019/03/liftoff-01/) for\\n  the past thirty days to keep you updated on our day-to-day progress.\\n\\n## Which features made it into 1.0? And which didn\u2019t (yet)?\\n\\nUppy 1.0 feature list:\\n\\n- Sleek user interface\\n- Lightweight and easy on dependencies\\n- A small core with modular architecture: everything is a plugin\\n- Uses modern JavaScript with transpiled ES5 versions available in `lib`, and\\n  minified versions for direct use by browsers in `dist`\\n- Usable as a bundle straight from a CDN, as well as a module to import\\n- Resumable file uploads via the open Tus standard\\n- Direct uploads to S3\\n- Webcam support\\n- Picking files from Dropbox, Google Drive and Instagram, while letting servers\\n  do the heavy lifting via Companion\\n- Robust: retries for all-the-things\\n- Built with accessibility in mind (not perfect yet, but we constantly improve)\\n- File recovery (after a browser crash or accidental navigation) via Golden\\n  Retriever\\n- Locale support: easily switch languages or supply your own copy\\n- Compatible with React (React Native in beta)\\n- Works great on mobile\\n- Works great with Transloadit, works great without\\n\\nWe also left two features \u201cbehind\u201d:\\n\\n> Offering sugared shortcuts for novice users (presets)\\n\\nWe felt that Uppy is straightforward enough to use, and presets could end up\\nmaking this less clear. Robodog does offer less \u201cboilerplatey\u201d integrations, but\\nthis was done as a wrapper instead of a preset.\\n\\n> Themable UI with a beautiful default\\n\\nInstead of going for `{ theme: \'dark\' }`, we only offer theming via CSS. For\\ninstance, it\u2019s feasible to utilize the `prefers-color-scheme` media query for\\nthat.\\n\\nLastly, our \u201cpicking files from remote sources\u201d feature isn\u2019t quite as full\\nfledged as we maybe would have liked, since support for Google Photos, Box or\\nFacebook is currently not included. We hope these are things that the community\\ncan help with.\\n\\n## What\u2019s next for Uppy?\\n\\nDoes this mean Uppy is perfect? Nope!\\n\\nThere are still quite a lot of\\n[issues](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues) and items in our backlog,\\nand we are already\\n[planning Uppy 1.1](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#11).\\nWe also want to maybe release a WordPress plugin, add image cropping, and much\\nmore, but we are releasing 1.0 today because it contains virtually all of the\\nfeatures that we set out to implement. These features have all been documented\\nand we don\u2019t expect their APIs to change. If, at some point, they do need to\\nchange, we will have to handle that with care. For instance, by shipping a 2.0\\nversion and making all the noise that comes with it.\\n\\nUppy has already seen serious usage by a seriously large community and by\\nvarious serious enterprises. So, with 1.0, we\u2019re now also signaling to you: Hey,\\nwe take this seriously and we won\u2019t be swapping things out from under your app,\\njust like that. Also, if you don\u2019t yet have Uppy powering your file uploads, now\\nis the best time to give it a shot!\\n\\nWe hope your users will be as delighted by Uppy 1.0 as we have been designing\\nand building it. Seeing your support and contributions while doing so, made all\\nthe difference. Thank you so much!

He also\\n  updated our\\n  [React Native example](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1469) to use\\n  Uppy 0.30.5.\\n\\n- We had a bit of an issue after releasing Uppy 0.30.5, which involved\\n  [404 errors being thrown](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/1466) for\\n  certain 0.30.5-specific CSS and JS files. This was an issue regarding one of\\n  our CDN scripts, which was aptly fixed by [Kevin](https://github.com/kvz).\\n\\n- [Abdel](https://github.com/kiloreux) is creating the French language pack for\\n  Uppy, and is considering working on an Arabic one for post-1.0 updates as\\n  well.\\n\\n- [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) has continued her work on\\n  [accessibility issues with Uppy\'s provider views](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/created_by/nqst)\\n  and is planning on adding her improvements in the coming days.\\n\\nDon\'t forget that today is Day 29 of our \'30 Days to Liftoff\' challenge.

They are considering to add a tus\\n  option to allow React Native developers to pass their own custom file picker\\n  module. This would add some flexibility for developers and prevent us from\\n  bloating tus-js-client.\\n\\n- Error reporting for the Transloadit plugin will be worked on by\\n  [Ren\xe9e](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop).

[Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju) and Artur\\ndelivered on the bare essentials for React Native. In our local tests, this\\nmeans we can now successfully pick different files, have their uploads resume\\nwhere they left off, select a remote file via Companion (for now, only picking\\nfrom URL is supported) and see the progress reported by it.\\n\\nThere is a basic UI, most of which is encapsulated in the example that we\'ll\\npublish on our website. We\'re refraining from building too much UI in our React\\nNative module, as we assume that developers will want to have full control and\\nstyle everything close to their app. We figured they would care most about\\nseeing a good example and having access to core functionality, such as making\\nmobile uploads more reliable and less draining on batteries and data plans.\\n\\nWhile there are still things to be implemented, such as picking files from\\nInstagram, we now know that we have all the Lego bricks required and that they\\nare doing what they\'re supposed to. Now, it\'s just a matter of fleshing out\\nthose integrations, but we\'ll have to see whether we can get to that before 1.0.\\nWe\'re already happy about having a fixed idea about the API and a basic working\\nexample as our deliverables!\\n\\n## In Progress\\n\\n- [Alex](https://github.com/nqst) is working on improving the Uppy design (in\\n  the code) in his `design-facelift` branch\\n\\n- [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) is working on improving accessibility\\n  together with Alex, who found many issues that we still need to fix in this\\n  area.\\n\\n- Now that the bare essentials of React Native work, Ife is making sure our\\n  local work finds a proper place in the tus-js-client (such as\\n  React-Native-compatible fingerprinting) while Artur hopes to find the time to\\n  tick off a few design goals to make for a better experience testdriving our\\n  example. Things like icons for files that are not images and a _Close_ button\\n  for the select file screen.\\n\\n- The whole team will again do a call this afternoon to reassess our roadmap and\\n  see where all we stand. Some new tasks were added on\\n  [Friday](/blog/2019/04/liftoff-11/), so we\'ll also have to see about getting\\n  those into gear.\\n\\nThat\'s it for Day 14.

While it isn\u2019t 1.0 just quite yet, this is\\n  another step in the right direction. Uppy `0.30.4` features fixes for\\n  `allowSyntheticImports`, Typescript typings, issues when using Companion\\n  Client for remote AWS-S3 uploads, and using websockets and console.dir in\\n  React Native.\\n\\n- Artur and [Ren\xe9e](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop) reviewed and merged a\\n  [PR](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1360) that allows a user to\\n  customize the status of an upload in Uppy.

One more bug squashed!\\n\\n- One small chore was done by [Ren\xe9e](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop),\\n  involving [adding git to the Companion\\n  dockerfile](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1404), which was needed\\n  to install tus-js-client and ensure Companion could be deployed successfully\\n  on our continuous integration server.\\n\\nWhile not strictly related to our Uppy 1.0 release, we have managed to reach\\nover 6000 commits to our master branch and 99 contributors in the [Uppy\\nrepo](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy).

Here\'s a list of completed tasks directly from the team:\\n\\n  - [x] Make the \'Import from URL\' example work in RN\\n  - [x] Give it its own UI, (re)written for RN\\n  - [x] Make websocket progress from Companion work (see:\\n        <https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/network#websocket-support>)\\n  - [x] Have an example with buttons for resumability and a progress bar\\n  - [x] Have 20 min resumability support, proof that fingerprinting works for\\n        different local file uploads, fix it if not\\n\\n- A [feature](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1367) was submitted by\\n  [Andrew Shini](https://github.com/superandrew213) that involving checking for\\n  existing uploads before uploading anything, which has been necessary for his\\n  custom dashboard. Artur and [Ren\xe9e](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop) will be\\n  reviewing it. A big thank you to the open source community for making\\n  contributions!\\n\\n## In Progress\\n\\nMeanwhile, on the progress side of things:\\n\\n- [Abdel](https://github.com/Kiloreux) has started working on a\\n  [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) demo involving Companion, so users can have an\\n  even easier time utilizing our services. He\'s also working on fixing up the\\n  Serverless example (running Companion on AWS Lambda) which was once\\n  contributed by the community but hasn\'t been workin for a long time :scream:\\n\\n- Ren\xe9e is going to spend the day on getting Transloadit Assemblies to actually\\n  cancel when the Cancel button in the UI is pressed. As it stands, the upload\\n  cancels, but the Assembly keeps running until it eventually times out by\\n  itself.\\n\\n- [Tim](https://github.com/tim-kos) has started working on fixing an API problem\\n  that caused one of our end-to-end tests to intermittently fail and eventually\\n  turn off entirely.\\n\\n- Finally, the React Native team has already completed an impressive amount of\\n  tasks, but they aren\'t slowing down anytime soon. Development marches on as\\n  the team begins tackling the following tasks:\\n  - [ ] Add basic file preview to react native example. Can use `file.uri` for\\n        images, can use icons for `file.type===video/audio/document` (Artur\\n        Paikin)\\n  - [ ] Release Uppy (add inline customFingerPrint & AsyncStorage for now, we\'ll\\n        remove customFingerPrint later, once tus-js-client is in good shape)\\n        (Artur Paikin)\\n  - [ ] Test fingerprinting for Audio, Document (Artur Paikin)\\n  - [ ] Add customFingerPrint & hashCode into Ife\'s tus-js-client branch, add\\n        tests, get it into shape for Marius to review (Ifedapo Olarewaju)\\n\\nCome Thursday, they\'ll be having another call to discuss their completed work so\\nfar and map out the remaining RN tasks from there. I\'m looking forward to\\nsharing more details on that call soon!\\n\\nThe first third of our thirty-day challenge ends tomorrow with\\n[Day 10](/blog/2019/04/liftoff-10/).

We hope other languages\\nwill be picked up by the community!\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nThis is what our board currently looks like:\\n\\n<center><img src=\\"/img/blog/30daystoliftoff/2019-04-board.png\\" /><br /><br /></center>\\n\\nLet\'s take a look at the updates we can share with you today.\\n\\n## Done\\n\\n- [Artur](https://transloadit.com/about/#artur) merged this\\n  [PR](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1393) which removed the use of\\n  `window.location` from Companion\'s client, courtesy of\\n  [Ife](https://transloadit.com/about/#ife).\\n- [Alex](https://transloadit.com/about/#alex) improved the design of the\\n  drag-to-upload stage. <br />\\n\\nBefore:<br />\\n\\n<center><img width=\\"400\\" src=\\"/img/blog/30daystoliftoff/2019-04-02-before.png\\" /></center>\\nAfter:<br />\\n<center><img width=\\"400\\" src=\\"/img/blog/30daystoliftoff/2019-04-02-after.png\\" /></center>\\n\\n- [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) made sure that\\n  [file previews now form an even spread](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1398)\\n  across the width of the dashboard.\\n\\n## In Progress\\n\\n- We are currently investigating an\\n  [issue](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/issues/146) with `tus-js-client`,\\n  which affects uploads where the file size is larger than 500MB. Artur is now\\n  trying to execute a 600MB upload and then see if it crashes. After that, he\\n  will set chunkSize, test the upload again, and report back his findings so we\\n  can evaluate our next steps.\\n\\n- We are also doing more research on `tus-js-client` fingerprints. Since these\\n  are identical for each file on React Native, the team is figuring out how to\\n  properly identify files on that platform, because\\n  [the standard file properties that tus-js-client relies on](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/blob/master/lib/node/fingerprint.js)\\n  are not available.\\n\\n- We have our first WIP screenshot for the React Native implementation:\\n\\n<center><img width=\\"400\\" src=\\"/img/blog/30daystoliftoff/2019-04-02-wip-react-native.png\\" /></center>\\n\\n- [Abdel](https://transloadit.com/about/#abdel) is busy fixing the serverless\\n  examples where WebSockets are terminated when Uppy is deployed to Lambda\\n\\n- Evgenia is working on applying for\\n  [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/open-source?ref=pricing)\'s open\\n  source program, so we can hopefully test Uppy even more and make sure that 1.0\\n  is without any issues.\\n\\n- Ife is writing tests for the implementation of the `tus-js-client` URL\\n  storage.\\n\\nThat\'s all the updates I have for you today.

They settled on the following\\nsix subtasks, which I\'m copying directly from their notes: :)\\n\\n```markdown\\nMVP for React Native support should:\\n\\n- [ ] get a link provider example to work, including showing Companion progress\\n      and resumability\\n- [ ] get its own UI, (re)written for RN\\n- [ ] make websocket progress from Companion work (see:\\n      https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/network#websocket-support)\\n- [ ] have an example with buttons for resumability & a progress bar\\n- [ ] have resumability support within 20 min (easily tested by disabling WiFi\\n      on your workstation while uploading to master.tus.io)\\n- [ ] have an example with basic file previews (Uppy RN itself likely does not\\n      offer previews)\\n```\\n\\nThat\'s all the updates I have for you today.

We had already been laying the groundwork with the development of\\n[tus.io](https://tus.io/) and felt that its robust back-end deserved a front-end\\njust as robust, modern and user-friendly.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nBut what about open? We initially thought about building a proprietary uploader\\nthat would work exclusively with Transloadit\'s commercial service, but we\\nquickly turned around on it. We knew this could have a real impact. So, just\\nlike we did with Tus, we decided to make our new project open source. Three\\nyears, [16.000 stargazers](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/stargazers) and a\\nthriving community later \u2014 and we could not be happier. Well, apart from one\\nthing: **getting Uppy 1.0 out the door** has proven harder than expected. Issues\\nkeep piling up, which led us down countless sidetracks and hurt our capacity to\\nhammer out those final design goals.\\n\\nBut now it\'s time for all that to change. That\'s why, starting today, we are\\nallocating all of Transloadit\'s resources into making a big final push and\\ngetting Uppy ready for liftoff. Our goal is to launch on **April 25**, exactly\\nthirty days from now.\\n\\n<center><img width=\\"400\\" src=\\"https://media.giphy.com/media/kvw01ozJ06TxS/giphy.gif\\" /><br /><br /></center>\\n\\nWe\'ll need all the help we can get, so for the next thirty days, everyone here\\nat Transloadit is going to be working exclusively on tasks related to Uppy 1.0.\\nThat means the Uppy core team (obviously) and tus core team, our SDK teams, as\\nwell as our infra & API engineers, designers, content writers, and the founders\\nthemselves \u2014 we\'ll all be chipping in and doing our part to ensure liftoff in\\nthirty days. We\'re even adding someone new to the Uppy team in April. A warm\\nwelcome to [Evgenia Karunus](https://github.com/lakesare) :)\\n\\n## A new post every day\\n\\nWe have added all tasks to a project board and thought it might be a fun idea to\\nkeep you updated on our day-to-day progress. So, we set ourselves an additional\\nchallenge: apart from getting Uppy ready for 1.0, we\'re also going to **write a\\nblog post about it every day**, for thirty days. Starting with this one.\\n\\nA post each day may prove hard to do, but we think it\'s worth a try. It really\\nfits with the open way in which we have been developing Uppy for the past few\\nyears, and gives you a look behind the scenes as we\'re getting ready for the\\nhome stretch. And hopefully, we also succeed in spreading the word even further,\\nreaching people that don\'t yet know about Uppy, but would be happy to!\\n\\n## What\'s Uppy with you?\\n\\nWe\'d love to hear what you think. Whether it is about Uppy in general, or\\nspecific issues you feel cannot be forgotten before 1.0, or maybe even about\\nthis blog post challenge itself \u2014 leave a comment here, use our\\n[forum](https://community.transloadit.com/c/uppy) directly (it also hosts the\\ncomments), or let us know on Twitter via [@uppy_io](http://twitter.com/uppy_io/)\\nor [@transloadit](http://twitter.com/transloadit/).\\n\\n\x3c!-- <center><img width=\\"400\\"  class=\\"dropshadow\\" src=\\"https://media.giphy.com/media/RnX4q6yYDoYCI/giphy.gif\\" /></center> --\x3e\\n<center><img width=\\"400\\"  class=\\"dropshadow\\" src=\\"https://media.giphy.com/media/SjInxhAJTzU7S/giphy.gif\\" /><br /><br /></center>\\n\\nWe can use your help!

Uppy has a similarly\\nlarge feature set in dozens of plugins, but because of that it can be\\ncomplicated to wire everything up for the best experience.\\n\\n[Robodog](https://uppy.io/docs/robodog/) is a new Uppy-based library that has\\nbeen trained to work with Transloadit. It includes three components:\\n\\n1. **File picker,** using the Dashboard plugin you know and love for the modal\\n   UI, with support for imports from third-party services.\\n2. **Form:** integration with your existing HTML forms. Files will be uploaded\\n   to Transloadit, and the form will submit JSON information about the files and\\n   encoding results.\\n3. **Upload:** one-line programmatic uploads \u2014 call\\n   `transloadit.upload(files, opts)` and get an array of results back.\\n\\n<center><img src=\\"https://media.giphy.com/media/Eq7T3GwDAlggE/giphy.gif\\" /></center>\\n\\nHere\u2019s a demo:\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wide\\">\\n  <p class=\\"codepen\\" data-height=\\"600\\" data-theme-id=\\"light\\"  data-border-color=\\"#EB2177\\" data-default-tab=\\"js,result\\" data-user=\\"uppy\\" data-slug-hash=\\"gEgPav\\" style={{height: \\"600px\\", boxSizing: \\"border-box\\", display: \\"flex\\", alignItems: \\"center\\", justifyContent: \\"center\\", border: \\"2px solid black\\", margin: \\"1em 0\\", padding: \\"1em\\"}} data-pen-title=\\"Robodog: resizing and optimizing your avatar\\">\\n    <span>See the Pen <a href=\\"https://codepen.io/uppy/pen/gEgPav/\\">\\n    Robodog: resizing and optimizing your avatar</a> by Uppy File Uploader (<a href=\\"https://codepen.io/uppy\\">@uppy</a>)\\n    on <a href=\\"https://codepen.io\\">CodePen</a>.</span>\\n  </p>\\n  <script async src=\\"https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\\"><\/script>\\n</figure>\\n\\nYou can install Robodog from NPM:\\n\\n```sh\\nnpm install @uppy/robodog --save\\n```\\n\\nOr import it by using an HTML script tag:\\n\\n```html\\n<link\\n\\trel=\\"stylesheet\\"\\n\\thref=\\"https://releases.transloadit.com/uppy/v0.30.3/robodog.min.css\\"\\n/>\\n<script src=\\"https://releases.transloadit.com/uppy/v0.30.3/robodog.min.js\\"><\/script>\\n```\\n\\n<center><img src=\\"https://media.giphy.com/media/MqGA1Za9ar6lG/giphy.gif\\" /></center>\\n\\n## Dashboard Improvements\\n\\nAs usual, we are making constant iterations and improvements to the Dashboard\\nplugin.

The highlights of this release are: separating Core and Plugin\\nstyles, more accurate progress reporting by factoring in sizes across files,\\nadding a `responseType` option for XHR Upload, and fixing visual Webcam bugs.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Separate Core and Plugin styles\\n\\n**\u26a0\ufe0f breaking**\\n\\nWhen installing `uppy` and Plugins from npm, you had to include their styles.\\nPrior to this release, you only had to include the Plugin\u2019s CSS, say, for\\n`@uppy/webcam`:\\n\\n```js\\nimport Uppy from \'@uppy/core\';\\nimport Webcam from \'@uppy/webcam\';\\nimport \'@uppy/webcam/dist/style.css\';\\n```\\n\\nEach plugin\'s file contained the Core styles. If you added multiple plugins, the\\ncore styles ended up being duplicated. This bloated file sizes and could even\\nbreak styles entirely because of CSS\'s precedence rules.\\n\\nNow, you have to include \u201cgeneral\u201d styles from `@uppy/core` as well:\\n\\n```js\\nimport Uppy from \'@uppy/core\';\\nimport Webcam from \'@uppy/webcam\';\\nimport \'@uppy/core/dist/style.css\'; // <-- add this separately and one time only\\nimport \'@uppy/webcam/dist/style.css\';\\n```\\n\\nThus, the Core styles are only included once. `@uppy/core` styles must be\\nincluded before Plugin styles.\\n\\nPlease see the [documentation](https://uppy.io/docs/) for the Plugin you are\\nusing to find out whether it requires a CSS file to work. Generally speaking, UI\\nplugins, such as the Dashboard, Webcam and Status Bar, need a CSS file, while\\nutility plugins, such as Tus or XHR Upload, don\u2019t.\\n\\n\u26a0\ufe0f Important things to remember:\\n\\n1. Dashboard is a universal UI that comes with the Status Bar and Informer\\n   Plugins built in, and as such, Dashboard styles already come with the\\n   Informer and Status Bar styles.\\n2. Dashboard also ships with \u201cRemote Provider\u201d styles \u2014 you don\u2019t need to\\n   include anything besides `@uppy/dashboard/dist/style.css` for Google Drive,\\n   Instagram and Dropbox to work. However, the Url and Webcam plugins still have\\n   to be included manually. Here\u2019s an example:\\n\\n```js\\nimport Uppy from \'@uppy/core\';\\nimport Dashboard from \'@uppy/webcam\';\\nimport GoogleDrive from \'@uppy/google-drive\';\\nimport Webcam from \'@uppy/webcam\';\\nimport Url from \'@uppy/url\';\\n\\n// Core and Dashboard styles, then Webcam and Url, but not for GoogleDrive \u2014\\n// those come with Dashboard\\nimport \'@uppy/core/dist/style.css\';\\nimport \'@uppy/dashboard/dist/style.css\';\\nimport \'@uppy/webcam/dist/style.css\';\\nimport \'@uppy/url/dist/style.css\';\\n```\\n\\n## Using File Sizes For Progress Calculation\\n\\nWhen possible, file sizes are now used for calculating the total progress.\\nBefore, we\u2019ve used uploaded percentage for each file. Meaning that if you were\\nuploading four files \u2014 and three small were already uploaded, while one very\\nlarge file was still in progress \u2014 Uppy might still display progress as being\\n90%. Long story short, Uppy now has a more accurate progress bar \ud83d\ude80\\n\\nSome internal details, if you are interested:\\n\\n1. If there are files without sizes, the average size of all other files is\\n   assumed for the unsized files.\\n2. If there are no files with sizes, the percentage is just based on the\\n   percentages of the unsized files.\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/blog/0.29/progress-size-calculation.jpg\\" />\\n\\n## `responseType` For XHR Upload\\n\\nWhen using XHR Upload, you can now configure the XMLHttpRequest `.responseType`\\nvalue. This allows the S3 Plugin to tell Firefox not to log XML errors when\\ngetting empty responses, so it finally fixes the spurious warnings that were\\ncaused by this, see [#518](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/518).\\n\\nBecause AwsS3 now sets `responseType`: `\'text\'`, we can no longer use the\\n`responseXML` property. We already did text based parsing for successful\\nresponses, and will now do the same for error responses.\\n\\n## Misc Changes\\n\\n- @uppy/core: Don\'t pass removed file IDs to next upload step, fixes (#1148 /\\n  @goto-bus-stop)\\n- @uppy/core: Fixed getFileType() when passed a file with an uppercase extension\\n  (#1169 / @jderrough)\\n- @uppy/companion: Use `createCipheriv` instead of deprecated `createCipher`\\n  (#1149 / @goto-bus-stop)\\n- @uppy/companion: Store Provider instances on `this.provider` instead of\\n  `this[this.id]` (@goto-bus-stop / #1174)\\n- @uppy/companion: Pin grant to known stable version (@ifedapoolarewaju / #1165)\\n- @uppy/companion: Fix \u2014 socket does not handle server.path option (#1142 /\\n  @tranvansang)\\n- @uppy/webcam: Fix a bug with Webcam video overflowing its container\\n  (68730f8a1bf731898d46883e00fed937d3ab54ab / @arturi)\\n- docs: Add `triggerUploadOnSubmit` to Form docs, add docs about options of\\n  hiding upload/pause/resume/cancel buttons; talk about bundler-less polyfill\\n  use (@goto-bus-stop, @arturi)\\n- @uppy/react: Allow Dashboard props width and height to accept a string for\\n  100% (#1129 / craigcbrunner)\\n\\nSee the\\n[full changelog (0.29)](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0290)\\nfor more details."},{"id":"2018/10/0.28","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2018/10/0.28","editUrl":"https://github.com/transloadit/uppy.io/tree/main/blog/2018-10-0.28.md","source":"@site/blog/2018-10-0.28.md","title":"Uppy 0.28: A look behind the scenes","description":"In 0.28, we are introducing a new \u201cSingle Upload\u201d mode, improving on the","date":"2018-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 5, 2018","tags":[],"readingTime":4.71,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"renee"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Uppy 0.28: A look behind the scenes","date":"2018-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","author":"renee","image":"https://uppy.io/img/blog/0.28/dashboard-uploading.jpg","published":true,"slug":"2018/10/0.28"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Uppy 0.29: separate Core and Plugin styles, React Native in tus-js-client","permalink":"/blog/2018/12/0.29"},"nextItem":{"title":"Uppy 0.27: First Swing at React Native Support","permalink":"/blog/2018/08/0.27"}},"content":"<img className=\\"border\\" src=\\"/img/blog/0.28/dashboard-uploading.jpg\\" />\\n\\nIn `0.28`, we are introducing a new \u201cSingle Upload\u201d mode, improving on the\\nStatus Bar plugin with a spinner and different pause/resume/cancel buttons.\\nWe\'ll also share some progress on bringing back unified locale packs and a\\nTransloadit Preset \ud83c\udf41\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Single Uploads\\n\\nUppy has been flexible about uploading lots of things from the start. You can\\nadd files at any time, even after uploads have already started. This is neat,\\nbut not always the desired behaviour: sometimes, you just want to upload a few\\nfiles together with a form. In that case, it\'s useful to allow users to only\\nupload a set of files _once_. 0.28.0 adds some options to help with that!\\n\\nAn upload in Uppy terminology can be more than one file. Users can add a bunch\\nof files and when they press \\"Upload\\", all those files are bunched up into an\\nupload. They can then add more files and press the \\"Upload\\" button again: the\\n_new_ files are bunched into a second upload.\\n\\nThe new\\n[`allowMultipleUploads`](https://uppy.io/docs/uppy/#allowMultipleUploads-true)\\noption in Uppy Core can be set to `false` to only allow a single one of those\\nuploads. Once an upload is started, the Dashboard and Status Bar no longer show\\n\\"add files\\" and \\"upload\\" buttons. You can listen for a \'complete\' event and then\\nsafely continue your app\'s form flow.\\n\\nThe Dashboard also has a new option:\\n[`closeAfterFinish`](https://uppy.io/docs/dashboard/#closeAfterFinish-false).\\nWhen `true`, the modal Dashboard will automatically hide once an upload has\\ncompleted. You should only use this option in conjunction with\\n`allowMultipleUploads`, otherwise it might close the Dashboard when the user\\nisn\'t done yet! It can only be used with the modal Dashboard, when\\n[`inline`](https://uppy.io/docs/dashboard/#inline-false) is set to `false`.\\n\\"Closing\\" an inline Dashboard makes no sense :smile: You will see a warning in\\nthe console in both cases, so you don\'t have to remember all that.\\n\\nSpeaking of the Dashboard, it now also shows more statuses in the title bar:\\n\u201cUpload complete\u201d, \u201cUpload paused\u201d, \u201cProcessing 5 files\u201d and \u201cUploading 5\\nfiles\u201d.\\n\\n## Status Bar improvements\\n\\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **breaking** We\u2019ve added separate options for hiding pause/resume and\\n  cancel buttons. So now there are several options for buttons:\\n  `hideUploadButton`, `hideRetryButton`, `hidePauseResumeButton` and\\n  `hideCancelButton`. These options can be passed from the Dashboard, if you are\\n  not using Status Bar separately (most common case). See the docs for more\\n  info: <https://uppy.io/docs/status-bar/>.\\n- The Status Bar now features a spinner animation when upload is in progress.\\n- Encoding (with the Transloadit plugin, for example) and uploading progress now\\n  get different colors, so it\u2019s easier to tell what\u2019s happening, visually.\\n\\n<img className=\\"border\\" style={{borderTop: 0}}\\nsrc=\\"/img/blog/0.28/status-bar-uploading.png\\" />\\n\\n<img className=\\"border\\" style={{borderTop: 0}}\\nsrc=\\"/img/blog/0.28/status-bar-paused.png\\" />\\n\\n<img className=\\"border\\" style={{borderTop: 0}}\\nsrc=\\"/img/blog/0.28/status-bar-encoding.png\\" />\\n\\n<img className=\\"border\\" style={{borderTop: 0}}\\nsrc=\\"/img/blog/0.28/status-bar-complete.png\\" />\\n\\n## Locale packs\\n\\nIn the beginning, we used to have unified locale packs for text strings in Uppy\\n\u2014 English, Russian, German, Polish, etc. Then we made a switch to per-plugin\\nlocales, and the ability to load one file with locale strings in any language\\n(locale pack) was lost for a while. This release is the first step in bringing\\nthis functionality back.\\n\\nWith this change, you can load a locale pack like so:\\n`const uppy = Uppy({locale: german})`, then still override specific strings in a\\ncertain plugin, if needed:\\n\\n```js\\nconst uppy = Uppy({ locale: german });\\nuppy.use(Dashboard, {\\n\\ttrigger: \'#pick-files\',\\n\\tlocale: {\\n\\t\\tstrings: {\\n\\t\\t\\tdropPasteImport: \'Something else here, %{browse} or this\',\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t},\\n});\\n```\\n\\nThe benefit to this is that there will be a central point of configuration for\\nlanguages, so there could be language packs with strings for, e.g., Czech at\\n@uppy/lang-cz (or @uppy/langs/cz) that would be very easy to contribute to (or\\nuse).\\n\\nAfter Uppy 0.28.0, this functionality is technically possible, but we still need\\nto update and publish locale packs for multiple languages.\\n\\n## Hosted Companion with Transloadit\\n\\nWhen using remote providers such as Google Drive and Dropbox, so that your users\\ncan pick files from these sources, you can host\\n[Companion](https://uppy.io/docs/companion/) yourself, or use the one provided\\nby Transloadit. And to simplify the latter, you can now use\\n`Transloadit.COMPANION` and `Transloadit.COMPANION_PATTERN` constants in remote\\nprovider options:\\n\\n```js\\nconst Dropbox = require(\'@uppy/dropbox\');\\nconst Transloadit = require(\'@uppy/transloadit\');\\n\\nuppy.use(Dropbox, {\\n\\tserverUrl: Transloadit.COMPANION,\\n\\tserverPattern: Transloadit.COMPANION_PATTERN,\\n});\\n```\\n\\nPlease see [Transloadit plugin documentation](https://uppy.io/docs/transloadit/)\\nfor more details.\\n\\n## Transloadit Preset\\n\\nLately, we\'ve been working on a wrapper package around Uppy and the\\n[Transloadit plugin](https://uppy.io/docs/transloadit/) that will make common\\nTransloadit-based workflows much simpler to implement. It\'s not ready just yet,\\nbut it should land in the next month!\\n\\nThis \\"preset\\" will provide three or so simple methods:\\n\\n- `transloadit.form()`, to enhance a form with existing file `<input>`s with\\n  Transloadit encoding capabilities, powered by Uppy\'s resilient uploading\\n  plugins\\n- `transloadit.modal()`, to show a one-off modal Dashboard that uploads to\\n  Transloadit\'s encoding backend\\n- `transloadit.upload()`, to instruct Uppy to upload files, using your own UI\\n  instead\\n\\nStay tuned!\\n\\n## Other Cool Changes\\n\\n- @uppy/core: \u26a0\ufe0f **breaking** remove `upload-cancel` event, `file-removed`\\n  should be enough, see [#1069](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1069)\\n  for details\\n- @uppy/companion: \u26a0\ufe0f **breaking** Migrated provider adapter to Companion: saves\\n  5KB on the frontend, all heavy lifting moved to the server side\\n- @uppy/companion: Removed an erroneous TypeScript dependency that added 40MB to\\n  the install size\\n- @uppy/thumbnail-generator: You can now constrain thumbnail height, thanks to\\n  @richartkeil, see [#1096](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1096) for\\n  documentation (we are planning to add real Thumbnail Generator documentation\\n  soon, too!)\\n- @uppy/webcam: Fix getting data from Webcam recording if mime type includes\\n  codec metadata ([#1094](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1094) /\\n  @goto-bus-stop)\\n- meta: Added integration tests (in real browsers, thanks to Sauce Labs) for\\n  @uppy/url, @uppy/transloadit and @uppy/thumbnail-generator \ud83d\ude80\\n\\nSee\\n[full changelog (0.28 and 0.27.x patches) for more](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0280)\\n\\nSee you in the next release!\\n\\nThe Uppy Team"},{"id":"2018/08/0.27","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2018/08/0.27","editUrl":"https://github.com/transloadit/uppy.io/tree/main/blog/2018-08-0.27.md","source":"@site/blog/2018-08-0.27.md","title":"Uppy 0.27: First Swing at React Native Support","description":"In 0.27, we have some more iterations on the Dashboard UI for you in store","date":"2018-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 23, 2018","tags":[],"readingTime":4.62,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"ife"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Uppy 0.27: First Swing at React Native Support","date":"2018-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","author":"ife","image":"https://uppy.io/img/blog/0.27/uppy-add-initial.jpg","slug":"2018/08/0.27"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Uppy 0.28: A look behind the scenes","permalink":"/blog/2018/10/0.28"},"nextItem":{"title":"Uppy 0.26: Lerna","permalink":"/blog/2018/07/0.26"}},"content":"<img src=\\"/img/blog/0.27/uppy-add-initial.jpg\\" />\\n\\nIn `0.27`, we have some more iterations on the Dashboard UI for you in store\\nagain. We are getting rid of the permanent tab bar and made tons of other\\nimprovements!\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Dashboard UI without tabs\\n\\nUppy used to always display the tab bar (the one you use to select between\\nimporting files from Instagram, Webcam, local disk, etc.). This ended up not\\nworking well with the growing list of supported sources, especially on mobile.\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/blog/0.27/uppy-with-tabs.jpg\\" />\\n\\nSo in `0.27`, we are iterating on the UI again:\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/blog/0.27/uppy-add-initial.jpg\\" />\\n\\nThe providers are now visible as a list of icons on the initial screen (plus,\\nwe\u2019ve added colors!), but when you complete the inital selection, it is hidden\\nbehind the \u201cplus\u201d button:\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/blog/0.27/uppy-files-selected.jpg\\" />\\n\\nYou can always add more:\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/blog/0.27/uppy-add-more.jpg\\" />\\n\\nThe StatusBar that shows progress has been \u201clightened\u201d:\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/blog/0.27/uppy-upload-in-progress.jpg\\" />\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/blog/0.27/uppy-upload-complete.jpg\\" />\\n\\nWe have decided to drop multiple-color support, so Informer messages will now\\nalways appear in a gray, round bubble. Apart from that, we have made tons of\\nsmall fixes, such as better animations, colors, font sizes, and more.\\n[Check out the PR #942](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/942) for\\ndetails.\\n\\nWe are aiming to make the UI less heavy, so that Uppy can easier fit within your\\nexisting site or app design.\\n\\nThe mobile version is now much more refined as well:\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/blog/0.27/uppy-mobile.jpg\\" />\\n\\nAs always, feel free to\\n[try Uppy live on the Dashboard example](https://uppy.io/examples/dashboard/).\\n\\n## `autoProceed: false` by default\\n\\n\u26a0\ufe0f **breaking**\\n\\nBy default, Uppy used to begin uploading right after you selected a file. If you\\nwanted to let users edit some file metadata or pick and choose from multiple\\nsources first, you had to set `autoProceed: false`:\\n\\n```js\\n// this line could be seen in many of the Uppy examples\\nconst uppy = Uppy({ autoProceed: false });\\n```\\n\\nSince in most cases we actually wanted `autoProceed: false`, this is now the new\\ndefault. While it makes Uppy\'s UI less magical and harder to make irreversible\\nmistakes with, right out of the box, we feel this is the way to go. Make sure\\nyou change this in your project if needed. If you weren\'t setting an\\n`autoProceed` option at all, you will now have to add `autoProceed: true`.\\n\\n## Progress on React Native\\n\\nWe\u2019ve begun working on supporting React Native in Uppy. Since `0.27`, it should\\nrun in a React Native environment \u2014 meaning you can use Uppy API\\n(`uppy.addFile()`, `uppy.upload()`) for adding files and uploading, without the\\nUI. `@uppy/xhr-upload` uploader is already supported, and we are working on\\nmaking `@uppy/tus` (and `tus-js-client` itself) run in React Native as well.\\n\\nWe plan to make sure all non-UI Uppy plugins work in RN, and then provide a few\\nuseful components for adding Uppy to your RN apps.\\n\\nPlease head to the\\n[React Native PR #988](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/988) for\\ndetails. We\'d love to hear what you think and your suggestions for improving the\\nUppy React Native experience.\\n\\nBuilt-in React Native support has been a 1.0 goal from the start. We have had\\nmany requests about Angular.js and Vue support. There are already\\ncommunity-built solutions for these platforms that seem to work well, but\\nunfortunately we won\'t be officially supporting them before our 1.0 milestone.\\nDepending on community input, we might add that later.\\n\\n## Package sizes\\n\\nWe now have a cool table showing mingzipped bundle sizes for each individual\\nUppy package:\\n\\n<img width=\\"400\\" src=\\"/img/blog/0.27/uppy-sizes.png\\" />\\n\\n## \\"Uppy Server\\" is now \\"Companion\\"\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install @uppy/companion\\n```\\n\\nUppy Server is an optional service that Uppy can use to import files from\\nsources like Instagram or Dropbox. However, simply naming it \\"Server\\" was quite\\nunclear and has caused some confusion. Many people thought you could upload\\nfiles to Uppy Server as well, but that is not the case. We recommend uploading\\nto a [tus.io](https://tus.io) server, or \u2014 if that\'s too much for your simple\\nusecase \u2014 using your existing webserver to handle the upload.\\n\\nSo, to hopefully end this confusion once and for all, we are renaming Uppy\\nServer to Companion: an optional tool in the datacenter, which you can use to\\nadd more functionality to your Uppy.js client. If nothing else, maybe it will\\nnet us some points for having yet another dog-themed name!\\n\\nSimultaneously, we moved Companion into the main\\n[transloadit/uppy](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy)\\n[monorepo](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md).\\nThis centralizes Uppy issue reporting and makes it easier to do updates and\\nsimultaneous releases of the client and Companion parts.\\n\\nThe first release of `@uppy/companion` is 0.14, and the last `uppy-server`\\nrelease is 0.13.4. `uppy-server` will be deprecated on npm soon.\\n\\nNote that despite the rename, configuration for standalone Companion still uses\\n`UPPYSERVER_` environment variables. This should ease the transition, since you\\nwill only have to update the package name for now. Once we add `COMPANION_`\\nvariable support, we will continue to support `UPPYSERVER_` environment\\nvariables to smoothen the transition. And of course, we will notify you here\\nwhen that time comes!\\n\\n## Other Cool Changes\\n\\n- @uppy/core: allow editing plugin titles (names) so that, for instance,\\n  \u201cCamera\u201d can be translated into different languages, fixes #920 (#942 /\\n  @arturi)\\n- @uppy/dashboard: fix animation \u2014 wait for closing animation to finish before\\n  opening modal (#942 / @arturi)\\n- @uppy/url: fix Url plugin reacting to wrong drop/paste events, add ignoreEvent\\n  (#942 / @arturi)\\n- build: build: Split integration tests and add one using create-react-app (#952\\n  / @goto-bus-stop)\\n- @uppy/companion: google Drive \u2014 move to v3 API (#977 / @pauln)\\n\\nSee\\n[full changelog (0.27 and 0.26.x patches) for more](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0270)\\n\\nSee you in the next release!\\n\\nThe Uppy Team"},{"id":"2018/07/0.26","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2018/07/0.26","editUrl":"https://github.com/transloadit/uppy.io/tree/main/blog/2018-07-0.26.md","source":"@site/blog/2018-07-0.26.md","title":"Uppy 0.26: Lerna","description":"Uppy 0.26 replaces the monolithic Uppy package with a separate npm package for","date":"2018-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 12, 2018","tags":[],"readingTime":2.56,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"renee"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Uppy 0.26: Lerna","date":"2018-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","author":"renee","image":"https://uppy.io/img/blog/0.26/uppy-multiple-packages.png","published":true,"slug":"2018/07/0.26"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Uppy 0.27: First Swing at React Native Support","permalink":"/blog/2018/08/0.27"},"nextItem":{"title":"Uppy 0.25: Drag & Drop Links Urls & Images, Improved File Selecting in Providers, Interactive Components In i18n","permalink":"/blog/2018/06/0.25"}},"content":"Uppy 0.26 replaces the monolithic Uppy package with a separate npm package for\\nevery plugin.\\n\\n<img width=\\"448\\" src=\\"/img/blog/0.26/uppy-multiple-packages.png\\" />\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Lerna\\n\\n\u26a0\ufe0f **breaking**\\n\\nAll Uppy plugins have moved into their own npm packages. This means you need to\\ninstall the plugins you use separately in the future, and you have to update all\\nyour Uppy `require()` calls or `import` paths.\\n\\nThe packages are published under the `@uppy` scope on npm:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install @uppy/core @uppy/dashboard @uppy/tus\\n```\\n\\nThis has some benefits, like:\\n\\n- No need to know the file path of a plugin\u2014use `@uppy/dashboard` instead of\\n  `uppy/lib/plugins/Dashboard`. This also allows us to move our file structure\\n  around internally without breaking everyone.\\n- Only have the code you actually use in `node_modules`\u2014large plugin\\n  dependencies are not installed if you don\'t use the plugin.\\n- Separate versioning allows making breaking changes in plugins, without\\n  requiring users of other unrelated plugins to upgrade.\\n\\nYou can still use the `uppy` package for now to simplify upgrading, although it\\nmay be deprecated in the future. It installs all the `@uppy/` packages and\\nre-exports them:\\n\\n```js\\nconst { Core, Dashboard, Tus } = require(\'uppy\');\\n```\\n\\nIt\'s very important to set up tree shaking when using Uppy in this way;\\notherwise you may include dozens of KBs of unused plugins. Using the `@uppy/`\\npackages instead is strongly recommended, as those do not include unused code in\\nthe first place.\\n\\n```js\\nconst Uppy = require(\'@uppy/core\');\\nconst Dashboard = require(\'@uppy/dashboard\');\\nconst Tus = require(\'@uppy/tus\');\\n```\\n\\nThe CSS required for plugins is included in each package at `dist/style.css`.\\nEach plugin contains _all_ the CSS it needs, eg. the Dashboard includes Status\\nBar CSS. If you use both plugins, only include the Dashboard CSS file. Even\\nbetter is to use a CSS minifier so any duplicate styles are removed for you :)\\nCaveats like this are documented on the plugin pages, and hopefully we can\\nsmooth it out over time!\\n\\n## Typings\\n\\n[@taoqf](https://github.com/taoqf) contributed TypeScript typings to 0.25\u20140.26\\nmoves those into each package and adds a few missing ones.\\n\\nWe\'re not TypeScript experts ourselves, so feedback, bug reports & PRs are very\\nmuch appreciated :sparkles:\\n\\n## Documentation Updates\\n\\nThe documentation sidebar now lists plugins in several sections. This should\\nmake it easier to navigate. Of course, each plugin page now lists the\\n`npm install` instruction needed to install it, too!\\n\\n## Renaming the `host` Option in Remote Providers\\n\\n\u26a0\ufe0f **breaking**\\n\\nThe `host` name in remote provider plugins was not great\u2014for one, it could be a\\nURL to an Uppy Server running in a subdirectory, not a hostname.

We now use a\\nplaceholder for e.g. buttons, so it works nicely in languages that have\\ndifferent word order than English. Example:\\n\\n```js\\ndropPasteImport: \'Drop files here, paste, import from one of the locations above or %{browse}\';\\nbrowse: \'browse\';\\n```\\n\\n`%{browse}` will be replaced with a button/link. Previously, these two strings\\nwere concatenated in the view layer, so the `browse` text would always be last.\\n\\nHere\u2019s a list of strings that were changed in this release, please update those\\nin your locales:\\n\\n- core: `failedToUpload` needs to contain `%{file}`, substituted by the name of\\n  the file that failed\\n- dashboard: `dropPaste` and `dropPasteImport` need to contain `%{browse}`,\\n  substituted by the \\"browse\\" text button\\n- dashboard: `editing` needs to contain `%{file}`, substituted by the name of\\n  the file being edited\\n- dashboard: `fileSource` and `importFrom` need to contain `%{name}`,\\n  substituted by the name of the provider\\n- dragdrop: `dropHereOr` needs to contain `%{browse}`, substituted by the\\n  \\"browse\\" text button\\n\\nThe full list of available locale strings for each plugin is now documented in\\nthe [Uppy Docs](/docs/).\\n\\n## React Documentation\\n\\nReact docs have been improved: we now have a [separate page](/docs/react/) for\\neach Uppy React wrapper component that we offer.\\n\\nOther improvements in docs:\\n\\n- The `id` option is now listed on each plugin\'s documentation page.\\n- The `replaceTargetContent` option is listed on UI plugin documentation pages.\\n- The `locale` option is described on each plugin documentation page, and\\n  includes a short description for each string.\\n\\n## Typescript Definitions\\n\\n[@taoqf](https://github.com/taoqf) went ahead and added a lot of type\\ndefinitions to Uppy in [#834](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/834). So\\nif you are using TypeScript (and even if not, your code editor / linting tool\\nlikely supports type definitions), you are in for a treat!\\n\\n## No need to `.run()`\\n\\n\u26a0\ufe0f**breaking**\\n\\nWe removed the need to type `uppy.run()` in\\n[#793](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/793). You now only have to call\\n`.use()` for the plugins that you need (as usual), and everything is then run\\nautomatically. It comes with a few tradeoffs but we were getting a big amount of\\nsupport tickets where people forgot to conclude with `.run()`, and we saw a\\nchance to reduce boilerplate, so we decided to go ahead and pave the cowpath.\\n\\n## Authorisation tokens in Local Storage\\n\\n\u26a0\ufe0f**breaking**\\n\\nAuthorisation tokens from Uppy Server are now stored in local storage as opposed\\nto cookies. Two primary reasons for this decision are:\\n\\n1. It avoids CSRF issues which are present when using cookies.\\n2. It allows for less stringent\\n   [CORS policies enforced by browsers](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/803#issuecomment-386257515),\\n   since we are no longer sending cookie credentials via Ajax requests.\\n\\nThis is a breaking change because it requires that the Uppy Server version\\nshould also be updated to **0.13.x** otherwise there could be unexpected\\nbehaviour.\\n\\nWhat\u2019s more about the Authorisation tokens is that they are now encrypted on the\\nserver before being sent down to the client.

In this\\nrelease, Dashboard\u2019s design has been refreshed, check this out:\\n\\n<img className=\\"border\\" src=\\"/img/blog/0.24/dashboard-main.jpg\\" />\\n\\n<img className=\\"border\\" src=\\"/img/blog/0.24/uppy-screenshot.jpg\\" />\\n\\nMeta editing screen:\\n\\n<img className=\\"border\\" src=\\"/img/blog/0.24/dashboard-meta-edit.jpg\\" />\\n\\nCamera screen:\\n\\n<img className=\\"border\\" src=\\"/img/blog/0.24/import-from-camera.jpg\\" />\\n\\nImport from URL (Link):\\n\\n<img className=\\"border\\" src=\\"/img/blog/0.24/import-from-url.jpg\\" />\\n\\nAnd more, check out the\\n[Dashboard example page](https://uppy.io/examples/dashboard/).\\n\\n## A Cleaner StatusBar\\n\\nThe StatusBar plugin used to show a lot of progress details. This has been\\nsimplified so that by default it will only show a percentage:\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/blog/0.24/statusbar-2.jpg\\" />\\n\\nBut there\u2019s an option `showProgressDetails: true` for both the StatusBar and\\nDashboard (which passes it to StatusBar included in the Dashboard) to bring back\\nthis detailed information, spread over two lines:\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/blog/0.24/statusbar-1.jpg\\" />\\n\\n```js\\nuppy.use(StatusBar, { ..., showProgressDetails: true })\\n\\n// or\\n\\nuppy.use(Dashboard, { ..., showProgressDetails: true })\\n```\\n\\nWe\u2019ve also added a handy \u201ccancel\u201d button, which will cancel everything in\\nprogress regardless of the type of the upload (wether uppy-server or local\\npowered, and wether tus-resumable or old school XHR/form uploads).\\n\\n## XHR Response Handling\\n\\nWhen the upload completes (regardless of whether it succeeded), a `response` key\\ngets added to the file. `file.response` contains a `status` and `data`\\nproperties. `data` is the result of the `getResponseData()` option. The\\n`getResponseData()` function\'s signature is now:\\n\\n```js\\ngetResponseData (responseText, response) { }\\n```\\n\\nThis is what the default JSON parsing implementation looks like in the\\n`XHRUpload` plugin, but you can override it with your own:\\n\\n```js\\ngetResponseData (responseText, response) {\\n  let parsedResponse = {}\\n  try {\\n    parsedResponse = JSON.parse(responseText)\\n  } catch (err) {\\n    console.log(err)\\n  }\\n\\n  return parsedResponse\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe `responseText` is the XHR endpoint response as a string. For uploads from\\nthe user\'s device, `response` is the\\n[XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest)\\nobject.\\n\\nWhen uploading files from remote providers such as Dropbox or Instagram, Uppy\\nServer sends upload response data to the client. This is made available in the\\n`getResponseData()` option as well. The `response` object from Uppy Server\\ncontains some properties named after their\\n[XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest)\\ncounterparts:\\n\\n- `response.responseText` - the XHR endpoint response as a string;\\n- `response.status` - the HTTP status code;\\n- `response.statusText` - the HTTP status text;\\n- `response.headers` - an object mapping lowercase header names to their values.\\n\\n## Powered by Uppy\\n\\nUppy is provided free for the world forever. In return, we ask that you consider\\nkeeping a tiny tasteful Uppy logo at the bottom of the Dashboard, so that more\\npeople can discover and enjoy Uppy. This _really helps_ to grow our community\\nwhich will result in more issues reported, more contributors, more features\\nrequested, more PRs merged, and a better Uppy for you to use tomorrow, for free,\\nforever.\\n\\nIf you don\'t want to do this indefinitely, consider doing this initially, just\\nto help us reach critical mass and get our _perpetuum mobile_ going.\\n\\nBut, Uppy is also free as in freedom. And so if you can\'t help our cause, set\\n`proudlyDisplayPoweredByUppy` to `false` to hide te Uppy logo.\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/blog/0.24/powered-by-1.jpg\\" />\\n\\n## Server News\\n\\nWe occasionally get questions about the required servers for Uppy. Uppy does not\\nrequire special servers. You can use Uppy for free in the browser and let it\\nupload to your existing Apache/Nginx server. Sprinkle a few lines of HTML/JS and\\nthat\'s it.\\n\\n**If you want integration with Instagram** Dropbox and friends, you\'ll need to\\nrun an \'Uppy Server\' in the datacenter to help with OAuth secrecy and fetching\\nlarge files and uploading those, bypassing the client. No fun to have several\\ngigabytes pass through your mobile tubes - best let the datacenters sort this\\nout among themselves. That\'s what Uppy Server is for.\\n\\n**If you want resumable uploads**, you\'ll need a <https://tus.io/> speaking\\nserver.\\n\\nYou can run these optional servers yourself, or use the hosted variants provided\\nby our company [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com/) for \ud83d\udcb8. Transloadit also\\nadds a wide range of encoding/processing features.\\n\\nNow that that\'s sorted out, let\'s see what we improved on the Uppy Server side!\\nWe tackled a number of security issues:\\n\\n- Fixed security vulnerability in transient dependency\\n  [#70](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy-server/issues/70)\\n- Auto-generate tmp download file name to avoid Path traversal\\n- Namespace redis key storage/lookup to avoid collisions\\n- Validate callback redirect url after completing OAuth\\n- Reduce the permission level required by Google Drive\\n\\nOther non-security improvements are:\\n\\n- Auto-generate Server secret if none is provided on startup\\n- We implemented a more standard logger for Uppy Server\\n- Added an example project to run Uppy Server on Serverless,\\n  [see](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy-server/tree/master/examples/serverless).\\n\\n## Docs\\n\\n- Uppy Server docs now point to a detailed write-up on how to run Uppy Server on\\n  Kubernetes (#706 / @kiloreux)\\n- An Uppy Server custom provider example has been added, so now it\u2019s easier\\n  create your own custom providers.\\n- Added more useful events, i18n strings, fixed typos, and other polish.\\n\\n## Other Fixes & Improvements\\n\\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **breaking** `addFile()`, `onBeforeFileAdded()` and `onBeforeUpload()` are\\n  now synchronous and have to return nothing or file objects to proceed, or\\n  false to abort; please check out the update docs for details:\\n  [onBeforeFileAdded()](https://uppy.io/docs/uppy/#onBeforeFileAdded) and\\n  [onBeforeUpload()](https://uppy.io/docs/uppy/#onBeforeUpload).\\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **breaking** Most events now emit the whole `file` object instead of a\\n  `fileId`. So you can access `file.name` right away, for example, so you no\\n  longer have to fish for the file using its id.\\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **breaking** We\u2019ve added `postcss-safe-important` to our style build step,\\n  so now 90% of rules got `!important` declaration added to them. This is done\\n  to prevent page styles (especially global ones like from Bootstrap) from\\n  leaking into the Uppy widget. There are other solutions we are looking into,\\n  like iFrames and WebComponents, this is an experiment. Keep in mind that to\\n  override Uppy styles, you now have to also use `!important`.\\n- dashboard: \u26a0\ufe0f **breaking** `maxWidth`, `maxHeight` options have been converted\\n  to `width` and `height`, because this makes more sense, `maxWidth` and\\n  `maxHeight` are actually `100%`.\\n- There is now an option `showLinkToFileUploadResult: false` to disable linking\\n  to the upload result in Dashboard UI.\\n- We are now using the image time and date as a file name in Instagram, instead\\n  of a generic file id.\\n- The URL plugin now checks for HTTP(S) protocol, and adds HTTP by default if no\\n  protocol is present.\\n- It\u2019s now possible to override `<DashboardModal />` React component\u2019s target\\n  prop.\\n- Provider views now have `showFilter` and `showBreadcrumbs` options, those are\\n  `false` for the Instagram plugin, for example.\\n- Uppy Server to Client communication has been refactored into `Provider` and\\n  `Request` modules. `Request` can be used when a simple request needs to be\\n  made to Uppy Server, like in the URL plugin. `Provider` is used for more\\n  complex implementations shared between Google Drive and Instagram, for\\n  example.\\n\\nFinally, we\u2019ve added a Transloadit example to the website,\\n[check it out](https://uppy.io/examples/transloadit/).\\n\\nHave fun,\\n\\nThe Uppy Team"},{"id":"2018/02/0.23","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2018/02/0.23","editUrl":"https://github.com/transloadit/uppy.io/tree/main/blog/2018-02-0.23.md","source":"@site/blog/2018-02-0.23.md","title":"Uppy 0.23: Import from Url, refactored thumbnail generation, XHR bundle","description":"Hi all!

We are back from holidays with a shiny new `0.23.0` release for you!\\nIt\u2019s packed with a new `Url` plugin (imports files from urls), refactored\\n`ThumbnailGenerator`, `Webcam` improvements and more.\\n\\n## Import from Url\\n\\nMeet our new \u201cProvider\u201d plugin, `Url`. It\u2019s simple, yet powerful: paste a link\\nto any file on the web, and Uppy with Uppy Server will upload it wherever you\\nneed.\\n\\n```js\\nuppy.use(Url, { target: Dashboard, host: YOUR_UPPY_SERVER_URL });\\n```\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wide\\"><video alt=\\"Demo video showing Uppy with Url plugin that imports files from urls\\" controls autoplay><source src=\\"/img/blog/0.23/uppy-url-demo.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />Your browser does not support the video tag, you can <a href=\\"https://uppy.io/img/blog/0.23/uppy-url-demo.mp4\\">download the video</a> to watch it.</video></figure>\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## ThumbnailGenerator\\n\\nThumbnail generation has been refactored to a separate `ThumbnailGenerator`\\nplugin, thanks to the PR from\\n[@richardwillars](https://github.com/richardwillars). So Uppy Core is now more\\nlightweight, if you don\u2019t need previews.\\n\\n`ThumbnailGenerator` is still bundled with our most feature complete `Dashboard`\\nplugin though, so you don\u2019t have to change anything if you were using that.\\n\\nWe\u2019ve also fixed previews in Safari and tweaked the code slightly after reading\\nthe excellent\\n[Image resize in browsers is broken](https://blog.uploadcare.com/image-resize-in-browsers-is-broken-e38eed08df01)\\npost by Uploadcare \ud83d\udc4c.\\n\\n## Processing results\\n\\nProcessing results from encoding plugins like\\n[`Transloadit`](https://uppy.io/docs/transloadit/), are now added to `complete`\\nevent:\\n\\n```js\\nuppy.on(\'complete\', (result) => {\\n\\tconsole.log(result);\\n\\t// result: {\\n\\t//   failed: [...],\\n\\t//   successful: [...],\\n\\t//   transloadit: [...],\\n\\t//   uploadID: \\"cjdnzj2zy0000c___iewu9m5y\\"\\n\\t// }\\n});\\n```\\n\\nAnd to `uppy.upload()` promise result too:\\n\\n```js\\nuppy.upload().then((result) => {\\n\\tconsole.log(result);\\n});\\n```\\n\\nYou can still use events like\\n[`transloadit:result`](https://uppy.io/docs/transloadit/#transloadit-result),\\nits just easier when things are in the same place. Plugins can use the new\\n`uppy.addResultData()` API to add data to the `result`, like so:\\n\\n```js\\nuppy.addResultData(uploadID, { transloadit: assemblies });\\n```\\n\\n## Webcam\\n\\nThe Webcam plugin now mirrors image previews by default, so when you are making\\na selfie and wave with your right hand, you see that right hand in the Webcam\\npreview, just like in the mirror. This option can be disabled via\\n`uppy.use(Webcam, { mirror: false }`. Note that the resulting image will not be\\nmirrored, so your hand will actually be waving on the left. This mimics the\\nbehaviour of smarphone selfie cameras.\\n\\nWe\u2019ve also added an option to select which camera will be used to capture\\npictures or video:\\n[facingMode](https://uppy.io/docs/webcam/#facingMode-39-user-39), set to `user`\\n(front camera) by default.\\n\\n## Server\\n\\n- You can now specify a config path when starting the standalone Uppy Server\\n  like so `uppy-server --config /path/to/uppyconf.json`. The config file is\\n  expected to be a JSON file with the same schema as the Uppy Server options.\\n- A periodic cleanup job has been added to Uppy Server, to delete stale upload\\n  files from the specified `filePath`. Even though we\'d rarely expect uploaded\\n  files to go undeleted immediately, there could be cases where an error occurs\\n  during an upload, and so Uppy Server leaves the file undeleted to give room\\n  for upload retries. With the cleanup job in place, we can ensure that this\\n  file would eventually be deleted after the file upload is done.\\n- Responses from Multipart uploads are now relayed to Uppy Client as they are\\n  received from the target server. With this in place, you can now handle\\n  responses from local and remote XHRUpload in nearly the same way.\\n\\n## Other Improvements and Additions\\n\\n- Added new option to hide ProgressBar and StatusBar after upload finish (#485 /\\n  @wilkoklak)\\n- Chaining API has been improved, you can now use `.on` and `.off` anywhere:\\n  `uppy.use(Dashboard).use(Tus).on(\'complete\', handleComplete).run()`\\n- The Transloadit plugin now has a new `transloadit:assembly-executing` event\\n  and passes Assembly results to the `complete` callback (#547, #527 /\\n  @goto-bus-stop)\\n- We\u2019ve added a `bundle` option to the `XHRUpload` plugin to send multiple files\\n  in one request (#442 / @goto-bus-stop)\\n- Uppy releases are now hosted on Edgly CDN by Transloadit\\n- A Third-party extension for integrating the Ngrx Angular state management\\n  library with Uppy has been released,\\n  [uppy-store-ngrx](https://github.com/rimlin/uppy-store-ngrx/) by @rimlin\\n\\n## Other Fixes\\n\\n- Fixed blank preview thumbnails for images in Safari; use slightly different\\n  step scaling (#458, #584 / @arturi)\\n- We now log in console and show an Informer message, not error in console, when\\n  file cannot be added due to restrictions (#604, #492 / @goto-bus-stop).\\n- Unused files have been removed from published package, saving many many\\n  precious megabytes :) (#586 / @goto-bus-stop)\\n- Use empty input value so same file can be selected multiple times (@arturi /\\n  #534)\\n- Fix modal and page scroll (#564 / @arturi)\\n- Refactor provider views (#554 / @arturi)\\n- Lots of documentation fixes, thanks to all our contributors!\\n\\n## Press\\n\\nUppy has made some appearances on the internet recently.\\n\\n1\\\\.\\n**[Better File Uploads with Shrine: Direct Uploads](https://janko.io/better-file-uploads-with-shrine-direct-uploads/)**:\\n\\nOn how to set up Uppy with [Shrine](http://shrinerb.com/), a file attachment\\ntoolkit for Ruby applications. It starts off with an example of a plain `<form>`\\nupload and builds up to a more advanced experience:\\n\\n> - When the user submits the form with selected files, there is no indicator\\n>   telling them when the upload will finish.\\n> - When the user is uploading multiple files at once and the request happens to\\n>   get aborted, it\u2019s not possible to keep the files that were uploaded so far,\\n>   because all files are sent in a single request. In other words, multiple\\n>   uploads are all-or-nothing.\\n> - Files are validated only after they have been uploaded, which means the user\\n>   needs to wait until the upload finishes before they can know whether their\\n>   file was even valid.\\n>\\n> We can improve that by asynchronously starting to upload files on the client\\n> side as soon as they\u2019re selected. This also gives users the ability to\\n> continue filling in other fields while files are being uploaded, because the\\n> UI isn\u2019t blocked during the upload.\\n>\\n> There are many popular JavaScript file upload libraries out there \u2013\\n> jQuery-File-Upload, Dropzone.js, FineUploader etc. \u2013 but the one you should\\n> use with Shrine is definitely Uppy \ud83d\udc36. Uppy is a modular library that knows\\n> how to upload files to a custom endpoint on your app, to Amazon S3, or even to\\n> a resumable endpoint, providing progress bars, drag & drop functionality,\\n> image previews, file validations etc, all while making as few assumptions as\\n> possible.\\n\\n2\\\\. **Featured\\n[in Javascript Daily](https://twitter.com/JavaScriptDaily/status/950348390268919809)**:\\n\\n> Uppy: A Powerful, Modular JavaScript File Uploader\\n\\n<cite>\u2014 JavaScript Daily</cite>\\n\\n3\\\\.\\n**[#1 Trending on GitHub](https://twitter.com/uppy_io/status/946485101541683201)\\naccross all languages**:\\n\\n> Today our open source efforts are outpacing those of MSFT GOOG FB combined :D\\n\\n<cite>\u2014 kvz, transloadit</cite>\\n\\n4\\\\. **[#2 Product of the Week](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/uppy-io) on\\nProductHunt**:\\n\\n> You literally solved my biggest problem, thank you for developing such a great\\n> project.\\n\\n<cite>\u2014 Chetan Menaria</cite>\\n\\n> Writing file upload functionality is always a pain in the arse.

Quick intro: Uppy is the next open source file\\nuploader for web browsers. We\'re very close to launching 1.0 and would love to\\nget your feedback in, leave your thoughts on Product Hunt or start a discussion\\nbelow.**\\n\\nHi all! It\u2019s New Year and Christmas time, and this year Santa is brining you\\nUppy `0.22` \ud83c\udf81 This release packs a lot of neat stuff, but it also breaks things\\nin quite a few places, so please read on.\\n\\nAnd, if you are celebrating, happy holidays from the Uppy Team! \ud83c\udf84\\n\\n\x3c!--more--\x3e\\n\\n## Preact and JSX\\n\\nWe\u2019ve been happy using `yo-yo` and `hyperx` template strings in our views for\\nquite a while, but decided to try something more stable. Preact has most of the\\ngreat ideas of React, plus smaller file size as well as a few good ideas of its\\nown.\\n\\nAll views have been refactored to utilize JSX. We actually liked hyperx a lot,\\nbut JSX has better tooling and syntax highlighting support. It also seems to be\\nthe standard in the React community.\\n\\nSee [#451 PR](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/451) for details on why\\nwe switched and discussion around the process.\\n\\n## Core and plugins refactor\\n\\n- **\u26a0\ufe0f Breaking** We\u2019ve renamed the `core` object to `uppy` in plugins. So\\n  instead of `this.core.state` we now use `this.uppy.state`.\\n- **\u26a0\ufe0f Breaking** Events have been renamed to remove the `core:` prefix. So\\n  `core:success` becomes just `success`, and this also results in now having\\n  `error`, `upload-started` and so on. Prefixed event names are used for\\n  plugin-specific event sometimes, like `dashboard:file-card`.\\n- **\u26a0\ufe0f Breaking** CSS class names have been altered to use the `uppy-`\\n  namespace, so `.UppyDashboard-files` becomes `.uppy-Dashboard-files` and so\\n  on.\\n- **\u26a0\ufe0f Breaking** `getMetaFromForm` was removed in favor of the new `Form`\\n  plugin (see below).\\n- **\u26a0\ufe0f Breaking** `MetaData` plugin was removed in favor of the `metaFields`\\n  option in Dashboard, [see docs](https://uppy.io/docs/dashboard/#metaFields)\\n  for more details.\\n- Plugins now use `this.el` to refer to their UI element instead of\\n  `this.target`.\\n- `setPluginState` and `getPluginState` are now used in Providers.\\n\\n## Refreshed Dashboard UI\\n\\n![Uppy Dashboard UI with 3 files selected](/img/blog/0.22/uppy-dashboard-updated.jpg)\\n\\n- File cards are simpler, we\u2019ve removed the excess white backgrounds, improved\\n  the remove icon, reduced paddings, added slight shadows.\\n- Cicular upload button in the Dashboard has been moved to the StatusBar. It\u2019s\\n  also not circular anymore, and there\u2019s no cloud icon. Plain and simple.\\n- Redesigned \u201cretry\u201d and \u201cadd +1 file\u201d buttons.\\n- Added `metaFields` option: an array of settings for UI field objects, which\\n  previousely lived in a separate `MetaData` plugin:\\n  `{ id: \'caption\', name: \'Caption\', placeholder: \'describe what the image is about\' }`,\\n  [see docs](https://uppy.io/docs/dashboard/#metaFields) for more details.\\n\\nSee [#434 PR](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/451) for more screenshots\\nand details.\\n\\n## Select multiple files in providers\\n\\nThanks to [@sadovnychyi](https://github.com/sadovnychyi), you can now select\\nmultiple files from remote providers like Google Drive and Instagram. You can\\nalso select folders, and even range of files by holding `shift` key when\\nclicking on first and last item in range.\\n\\n![Uppy Dashboard UI with 3 files selected](/img/blog/0.22/uppy-dashboard-provider-select.jpg)\\n\\n[Check it out \u2192](https://uppy.io/examples/dashboard/)\\n\\n## Stores\\n\\nAs you know, internally Uppy uses its own simple state management system with\\n`getState` and `setState` methods. In previous releases we\u2019ve added support for\\nRedux via a plugin called `Redux`, which mirrors all Uppy state to your Redux\\napplication\u2019s state, and a plugin called `ReduxDevTools` that connects to Redux\\nDevTools and enables all the cool time traveling stuff.\\n\\nWe are excited to tell you that this release makes state management even more\\nflexible by bringing support for external stores! Here\u2019s a quote from the docs:\\n\\n> By default, Uppy stores its internal state in an object.\\n>\\n> If your app uses a state management library such as Redux, it can be useful to\\n> have Uppy store its state there instead\u2014that way, you could write custom\\n> uploader UI components in the same way as the other components in the\\n> application.\\n\\nHere\u2019s how that works:\\n\\n```js\\nconst { createStore } = require(\'redux\')\\nconst ReduxStore = require(\'uppy/lib/store/ReduxStore\')\\n\\nconst reducer = combineReducers({\\n  ...reducers,\\n  uppy: ReduxStore.reducer\\n})\\nconst store = createStore(reducer)\\n\\nconst uppy = Uppy({\\n  store: ReduxStore({\\n    store: store // That\'s a lot of stores!\\n  })\\n})\\n...\\n```\\n\\nNow Uppy will use your app\u2019s Redux store instead of its own, so you have a\\n\u201csingle source of truth\u201d \ud83d\udd2e\\n\\nRead [more on stores](https://uppy.io/docs/guides/custom-stores/) in docs.\\n\\n## Form\\n\\n`Form` is a new plugin that can be used in conjunction with any other. Here\u2019s\\nwhat it does:\\n\\n1. Acquires metadata from a `<form>` element of your choosing before the upload\\n   starts in Uppy.\\n2. Injects result array of succesful and failed files back into the form.\\n\\n**\u26a0\ufe0f Breaking** With this plugin we\u2019ve deprecated `getMetaFromForm` option that\\nused to be in all acquire plugins like Dashboard and DragDrop. Now you can just\\nuse `Form`.\\n\\n```js\\nuppy.use(Form, {\\n\\ttarget: \'#my-form\',\\n});\\n```\\n\\nRead [more about the Form plugin](https://uppy.io/docs/form/) in docs.\\n\\n## Encoding support in GoldenRetriever\\n\\nOur browser crash / page refresh restore plugin `GoldenRetriever` (read\\n[more about it](https://uppy.io/docs/golden-retriever/)) now supports correctly\\nrestoring [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com) assemblies!\\n\\nAlso, we\u2019ve fixed restoring from paused state. Now uploads will remain paused\\nand not get out of sync.\\n\\n## Type-safe Server\\n\\nUppy Server now uses TypeScript to do some type checking at compile time. This\\nhelps spot some otherwise easy to miss runtime bugs. While the project\u2019s source\\nis still written in JavaScript, the use of\\n[JSDoc specifications is leveraged by TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Type-Checking-JavaScript-Files)\\nto detect data types and mistakes with that, within the project.\\n\\nThanks to this approach a number of hidden bugs have already been identified and\\nfixed, and it also makes Uppy Server very well documented. :)\\n\\n## And there\u2019s more\\n\\n- New `setFileState` method as a nice shorthand to update file-specific state.\\n- Added more extensions for mimetype detection.\\n- More plugin documentation \ud83d\udc4d\\n- Misc bugs fixes and improvements in Webcam, Dashboard, Provider, so things\\n  should be more stable all around.\\n- Added an option to limit simultaneous uploads in XHRUpload.\\n- Fixed remote server error handler for uppy-server.\\n- Added [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) to uppy-server to aid vulnerability detection.\\n\\n## Full Changelog\\n\\nHere is the full list of changes for version `0.22.0` (and patch `0.21.1`):\\n\\n- **\u26a0\ufe0f Breaking** core: rendering engine switched from `Yo-Yo` to `Preact`, and\\n  all views from `html` hyperx template strings to `JSX` (#451 / @arturi)\\n- **\u26a0\ufe0f Breaking** core: large refactor of Core and Plugins: `setFileState`,\\n  merge `MetaData` plugin into `Dashboard`, prefix \\"private\\" core methods with\\n  underscores (@arturi / #438)\\n- **\u26a0\ufe0f Breaking** core: renamed `core` to `uppy` in plugins and what not.

We\u2019ve been busy with Halloween, but also another release, so here is\\nUppy `0.21`! This one improves accessibility, features new end-to-end tests and\\nimproved security in Uppy Server.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Accessibility\\n\\nOne of the goals we\u2019ve set out to achieve with Uppy was to make an accessibe\\nfile upload widget, and in this release we\u2019ve achieved some more progress in\\nthis area:\\n\\n- Dashboard modal dialog now handles focus better (it\u2019s trapped inside the modal\\n  while open);\\n- First button is in focus right after the modal dialog is open;\\n- More (aria-)labels have been added;\\n- Files from remote providers are now selectable with a keyboard.\\n\\nWe plan to continue gradually improving in the accessibility area.\\n\\nSee [#414 PR](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/414) for details.\\n\\n## Returning `{ successful, failed }` from `uppy.upload()`\\n\\n**\u26a0\ufe0f Breaking change**\\n\\n`uppy.upload()` promise now resolves to a `result` object with two arrays of\\nfiles: `{ successful, failed }`. This lets you handle succesful and failed\\nuploads in one go:\\n\\n```js\\nuppy.upload().then((result) => {\\n\\tconsole.info(\'Successful uploads:\', result.successful);\\n\\tif (result.failed.length > 0) {\\n\\t\\tconsole.error(\'Errors:\');\\n\\t\\tresult.failed.forEach((file) => {\\n\\t\\t\\tconsole.error(file.error);\\n\\t\\t});\\n\\t}\\n});\\n\\n// or\\n\\nuppy.on(\'core:complete\', ({ successful, failed }) => {\\n\\tif (failed.length === 0) {\\n\\t\\tconsole.log(\'UPLOAD SUCCESSFUL!!!\');\\n\\t} else {\\n\\t\\tconsole.warn(\'UPLOAD FAILED!!!\');\\n\\t}\\n\\tconsole.log(\'successful files:\', successful);\\n\\tconsole.log(\'failed files:\', failed);\\n});\\n```\\n\\nSee [`uppy.upload()`](https://uppy.io/docs/uppy/#uppy-upload) and\\n[`core:complete`](https://uppy.io/docs/uppy/#core-complete) in docs, as well as\\n[#404 PR](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/404) for more details.\\n\\n## End to end tests\\n\\nWe\u2019ve refactored end to end tests to use [Webdriver.io](http://webdriver.io),\\nand for the occasion added tests for Edge, Safari, Android and iOS. Now tests on\\nTravis and Sauce Labs (thanks for the open source tier!) run smoothly and it\u2019s\\neasier to alter them or write new ones.\\n\\n## More secure Uppy Server\\n\\nWe made sure access tokens from third-party providers, such as Google Drive or\\nInstagram, are not stored on the server with Uppy Server, and kept in your\\nbrowser instead. Then, when you want to pick a file from your Instagram, the\\ntoken is used to make a request to Uppy Server, which is in turn used by Uppy\\nServer to communicate with Instagram.\\n\\nData validation is also now done during intiation of an upload, to prevent\\ncorrupt data from triggering funny behaviours on the server. :)\\n\\nAnd, while we were at this, we also made sure all sensitive data is masked in\\nrequest logs.\\n\\n## Migration to Dropbox v2 API\\n\\nSince the\\n[deprecation of Dropbox v1 API](https://blogs.dropbox.com/developers/2017/09/api-v1-shutdown-details/),\\nuppy/uppy-server have now been updated to use the v2 API. It is implemented to\\nwork closely as its previous implementation so there should be no worries.\\n\\n## Custom plugin id\\n\\nUp until now you could only use a plugin once with an Uppy instance. Now you can\\npass custom `id` for any plugin (though this has to be manually implemented in\\nany new plugin). This allows using, for example, two `StatusBar`s, one inside\\nthe `Dashboard`, and one somewhere on the page, visible even when `Dashboard` is\\nclosed.\\n\\nCan be used like this:\\n\\n```js\\n// one StatusBar comes included in the Dashboard, another will be mounted on the page\\n.use(Dashboard {...})\\n.use(StatusBar, { id: \'PageStatusBar\', target: \'body\' }\\n```\\n\\nSee [#418 PR](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/418) for details.\\n\\n## Misc good stuff\\n\\n- Migrated Dropbox in Uppy Server to use v2 API.\\n- Fixed generating thumbnails for images with transparent background.\\n- We are now using [`tinyify`](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop/tinyify)(by our\\n  own [@goto-bus-stop](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop)) for the Uppy bundle to\\n  make it smaller and more efficient.\\n- Instead of restarting only the file upload itself, start an entirely new\\n  upload for retries. Fixes retrying uploads with processing plugins.\\n- The S3 plugin now includes XHRUpload. **\u26a0\ufe0f Breaking change: you should remove\\n  `.use(XHRUpload)` when using S3.**\\n- XHRUpload now includes a timeout `opts.timeout = 30000`, after which it errors\\n  and offers a retry (retry UI supported in Dashboard), see\\n  [#378](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/378) for more.\\n- Renamed `RestoreFiles` \u2192 `GoldenRetriever`, and `Tus10` \u2192 `Tus`. **\u26a0\ufe0f Breaking\\n  change: please make sure to use the new names when setting up plugins**.\\n- The Webcam plugin has been refactored. There\u2019s no flash fallback now, it works\\n  in modern browsers only, and the Webcam tab won\u2019t appear in the Dashboard if a\\n  camera is not supported on the device.\\n\\n## Full Changelog\\n\\nHere is the full list of changes for version `0.21.0` (and patches `0.20.1`,\\n`0.20.2`, `0.20.3`):\\n\\n- accessibility: add tabindex=\\"0\\" to buttons and tabs, aria-labels, focus (#414\\n  / @arturi)\\n- core: allow setting custom `id` for plugins to allow a plugin to be used\\n  multiple times (#418 / @arturi)\\n- core: do not check isPreviewSupported for unknown filetypes (#417 /\\n  @sadovnychyi)\\n- core: refactor `uppy-base` (#382 / @goto-bus-stop)\\n- core: remove functions from state object (#408 / @goto-bus-stop)\\n- core: return `{ successful, failed }` from `uppy.upload()` (#404 /\\n  @goto-bus-stop)\\n- core: update state with error messages rather than error objects (#406 /\\n  @richardwillars)\\n- core: use `tinyify` for the unpkg bundle.

This one focuses on React and Redux\\nsupport, adding storage expirations to `GoldenRetriever` and upload retries.\\nEnjoy!\\n\\n## Uppy React components\\n\\nUppy now ships with React components! We\u2019ve been exploring different approaches\\nto React components for several months, so we\u2019re excited to finally have them in\\n\u2728 There are components for each of Uppy\u2019s UI elements, like the Dashboard and\\nthe StatusBar.\\n\\n```js\\nconst uppy = Uppy();\\nuppy.use(Tus10, { endpoint: \'/upload\' });\\n\\nconst Dashboard = require(\'uppy/lib/react/Dashboard\');\\n\\nconst Uploader = () => (\\n\\t<Dashboard uppy={uppy} note=\\"Hey! It\'s a React component!\\" />\\n);\\n\\nReactDOM.render(<Uploader />, document.querySelector(\'#uploader\'));\\n```\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n[Check out the docs for more!](/docs/react/)\\n\\n## Redux\\n\\n[@richardwillars](https://github.com/richardwillars) contributed a plugin that\\nwill sync Uppy\u2019s internal state with an existing Redux store. To use it, define\\na Redux action and reducer:\\n\\n```js\\n// The action creator receives 3 parameters:\\n// - The previous state\\n// - The new state\\n// - The change set\\nconst uppyStateUpdate = (previous, next, patch) => ({\\n\\ttype: \'UPPY_STATE_UPDATE\',\\n\\tprevious,\\n\\tnext,\\n\\tpatch,\\n});\\n\\nfunction reduce(state = {}, action) {\\n\\tif (action.type === \'UPPY_STATE_UPDATE\') {\\n\\t\\treturn {\\n\\t\\t\\t...state,\\n\\t\\t\\t// Merge in the changes.\\n\\t\\t\\t...action.patch,\\n\\t\\t};\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThen pass your Redux store\'s `dispatch` function and the action creator to the\\nRedux plugin:\\n\\n```js\\nconst ReduxStore = require(\'uppy/lib/Redux\');\\n\\nuppy.use(ReduxStore, {\\n\\tdispatch: store.dispatch,\\n\\taction: uppyStateUpdate,\\n});\\n```\\n\\n[See the docs](/docs/guides/custom-stores/)\\n\\n## Redux DevTools\\n\\nEven if you\'re not using Redux in your application, there\'s some Redux-related\\nnews! Uppy now has a new plugin, `ReduxDevTools`, which adds debug support for\\nRedux DevTools and allows you to time travel while debugging Uppy:\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wide\\"><video alt=\\"Demo video showing Uppy with Redux Dev Tools and time traveling\\" controls autoplay><source src=\\"/img/blog/0.20/uppy-reduxdevtools.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />Your browser does not support the video tag, you can <a href=\\"/img/blog/0.20/uppy-reduxdevtools.mp4\\">download the video</a> to watch it.</video></figure>\\n\\nTo try it, add the plugin:\\n\\n```js\\nconst ReduxDevTools = require(\'uppy/lib/plugins/ReduxDevTools\');\\n\\nuppy.use(ReduxDevTools);\\n```\\n\\nAnd then\\n[activate the browser extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension).\\n\\nSee [#373](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/373) for details and\\ndiscussion.\\n\\n## Retries\\n\\nWe\u2019ve added a retry UI to the `Dashboard`. If some of your uploads fail\u2014maybe\\nthe network is down or the endpoint is unresponsive\u2014you\u2019ll see this:\\n\\n<img alt=\\"Uppy Dashboard retry UI with individual retry buttons and \u201cretry all\u201d\\" src=\\"/img/blog/0.20/retry.jpg\\" />\\n\\nFrom here it\u2019s easy to retry individual uploads or all at once. This feature\\ncurrenty works best with `Tus10` plugin, and has basic `XHRUpload` support, but\\nwe\u2019ll improve on the latter in the future releases.\\n\\n## Re-designed Drag and Drop plugin\\n\\nThe old trustly `DragDrop` plugin has been re-designed by\\n[@arturi](https://github.com/arturi) and [@nqst](http://zaytsev.io):\\n\\n- Fresh simple design, arrow icon, white background;\\n- New sizing options: `width` and `height` (both `100%` by default to fill the\\n  entire container space);\\n- A `note` option, like in the `Dashboard`, to add info about restrictions or\\n  anything else you would like your users to know.\\n\\n<img className=\\"border\\" src=\\"/img/blog/0.20/dnd-gray.jpg\\" />\\n\\n**[Check it out](/examples/dragdrop/)**\\n\\n```js\\nuppy.use(DragDrop, {\\n\\ttarget: \'body\',\\n\\twidth: \'600px\',\\n\\theight: \'300px\',\\n\\tnote: \'Videos only, up to 100 MB\',\\n});\\n```\\n\\n## The Golden Retriever cleans up after itself\\n\\nWe recently released the `GoldenRetriever` plugin, which stores selected files\\non the client so that it can recover them after a browser crash. Previously,\\nthese stored files would stay around forever, and clog up the user\'s disk space.\\nAs of 0.20.0, files will be removed from client-side storage when they have been\\nuploaded. Files that have had nothing happen to them for longer than 24 hours\\nwill be cleaned up automatically. This timeframe can be configured using the new\\n`expires` option:\\n\\n```js\\nconst ms = require(\'ms\');\\n\\nuppy.use(GoldenRetriever, {\\n\\texpires: ms(\'4 hours\'),\\n});\\n```\\n\\n(The [`ms`](https://npmjs.com/package/ms) module is great for converting text\\ndurations to milliseconds!)\\n\\nThis will clean up files when Uppy runs, but perhaps not every page of your app\\nuses Uppy. If a user selected some files, but then never came back to that same\\npage, files could still hang around for a long time. To aid this, there\'s a new\\nmodule that you can call to clean up Uppy\'s cache without needing an Uppy\\ninstance:\\n\\n```js\\nconst cleanup = require(\'uppy/lib/plugins/GoldenRetriever/cleanup\');\\n\\ncleanup();\\n```\\n\\nWe\'ll hopefully make that require path easier to remember in the future :)\\n\\n## Misc good stuff\\n\\n- The GoldenRetriever now detects a serviceWorker registration\\n  automatically\u2014it\'s no longer necessary to emit an `core:sw-file-ready` event.\\n- Request headers are now configurable in the AWS S3 plugin.\\n- A new `setPluginState` allows plugins to set state scoped to the plugin.\\n- Some unused code was removed \ud83c\udf89\\n- More tests were added!

Check it out:\\n<https://uppy.io/docs/>. More chapters to come!\\n\\n## The GoldenRetriever\\n\\nThe GoldenRetriever has been released as a public beta. For details, please\\nrefer to the previous post,\\n[The GoldenRetriever: Making uploads survive browser crashes](https://uppy.io/blog/2017/07/golden-retriever/),\\nbut the gist is: when enabled, this plugin will save uppy-state to localStorage\\non every change, and then if your browser crashes, or you accidentaly navigate\\naway from a tab,later when you return, your uploads will resume like nothing\\nhappened. Spoiler: it uses Service Workers and IndexedDB.\\n\\n<img className=\\"border\\" src=\\"/img/blog/0.18/golden-retriever.jpg\\" />\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Multipart uploader is now XHRUpload\\n\\n`Multipart` has been replaced by a more flexible `XHRUpload`, so that other\\nplugins, like `AwsS3`, can depend on it.\\n\\n## AwsS3\\n\\nThe `AwsS3` plugin can be used to upload files directly to an S3 bucket.\\n\\nAs of now, the AwsS3 plugin \u201cdecorates\u201d the `XHRUpload` plugin. To upload files\\ndirectly to S3, both the `XHRUpload` and `AwsS3` plugins must be used:\\n\\n```js\\n// No options have to be provided to the XHRUpload plugin,\\n// the S3 plugin will configure it.\\nuppy.use(XHRUpload);\\nuppy.use(AwsS3, {\\n\\t// Options for S3\\n});\\n```\\n\\nPlease find [more info and examples](https://uppy.io/docs/aws-s3/) in the docs.\\n\\n## Transloadit `getAssemblyOptions`\\n\\nWe\u2019ve added a `getAssemblyOptions` function option to the `Transloadit` plugin.\\nThis option can return an object or a Promise for an object to configure the\\nTransloadit assembly. The returned object can contain params, a signature, and\\nfields.\\n\\n`getAssemblyOptions` is called on each file, so each file can return a different\\nset of options. Files that returned the same options are bundled together and\\nrun through a single assembly. Files that return different options will be run\\nthrough different assemblies.\\n\\nThis means that it is now possible to make assembly parameters depend on user\\ninput from eg. the `MetaData` plugin, and have different parameters for\\ndifferent files.

We released\\n[tus](https://tus.io): the open protocol for resumable file uploads, as well as\\nUppy: the next open source file uploader for web browsers. Uppy uses tus, which\\nmakes it resilient to poor network conditions and crashing servers. Today we\u2019re\\nlaunching an Uppy feature that also makes it resilient to browser crashes, which\\nwe believe is an industry first. We\u2019re sharing a quick\\n[demo](/blog/2017/07/golden-retriever/#demo) video, a bit of\\n[background](/blog/2017/07/golden-retriever/#uppy),\\n[how](/blog/2017/07/golden-retriever/#how) exactly we achieved this, and how you\\ncan [try](/blog/2017/07/golden-retriever/#try) it yourself.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nDon\u2019t you just hate it when you\u2019re about to share the perfect photos from your\\ntrip to Iceland, and halfway through, your cat jumps on the keyboard and trashes\\nyour browser?

(if that is still a thing ;)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n<a name=\\"demo\\"></a>\\n\\n## Demo\\n\\nFirst off, let\u2019s show you a demo \ud83d\udcf9 of Uppy surviving a browser crash and\\npicking up right where we left it:\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wide\\"><video alt=\\"Demo video showing the Golden Retriever file restoring plugin in action\\" controls><source src=\\"/img/blog/golden-retriever/uppy-golden-retriever-crash-demo-2.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />Your browser does not support the video tag, you can <a href=\\"https://uppy.io/img/blog/golden-retriever/uppy-golden-retriever-crash-demo-2.mp4\\">download the video</a> to watch it.</video></figure>\\n\\n<a name=\\"uppy\\"></a>\\n\\n## Uppy?\\n\\nFor those of you who are new here, Uppy is the next-gen open source file\\nuploader for the web. It is made by Transloadit and thus it works great with\\ntheir uploading & encoding platform \u2014 but it also works great without! Simply\\nadd Uppy JavaScript to your website, deploy your own tusd/Node.js/Apache/Nginx\\nserver, and be on your way. Add\\n[uppy-server](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy-server), and your users will\\nbe able to pick files from remote sources like Dropbox and Instagram. Uppy\u2019s\\nfocus is on the modern web, and we go through extreme lengths to achieve the\\nsmoothest of user experiences, and the most durable of reliabilities. \ud83d\ude43\\n\\n## Hacking trip\\n\\nOur core team is spread across three continents and five cities, and most of us\\nhave never met in person, with the majority of communication happening in GitHub\\nand Slack. Just last week, we got together in Berlin for a crazy week of pink\\nlimo rides, Indian food and Mario Kart 64. More on that on the\\n[Transloadit blog](https://transloadit.com/blog/2017/08/team-meetup-2017/).\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wide\\">\\n  <img src=\\"/img/blog/golden-retriever/uppy-team-kong.jpg\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\nWhile enjoying some world-famous-in-Germany \u201cFlammkuchen\u201d, we were thinking\\nabout even more ways to make file uploading better (yes, we really can\u2019t stop\\nthinking about that). We then sat together in one room for a few days of hacking\\nand came up with something neat.\\n\\n## The Golden Retriever\\n\\nUppy has a new friend to play with. Meet the Golden Retriever, our file recovery\\nplugin:\\n\\n<center><img src=\\"/img/blog/golden-retriever/catch-fail-2.gif\\" alt=\\"Golden Retriever failing to catch something\\" title=\\"Good try, girl!\\" /></center>\\n\\nAs you can see, we\u2019re not yet fully done with training her, but we\u2019re getting\\nthere! \ud83d\ude04\\n\\nBut wait, we can hear you think, didn\'t [tus.io](https://tus.io) already make\\nresumable uploads possible? Yes indeed, and it does an awesome job at recovering\\nfrom poor network conditions. However, if your browser suddenly decided to\\ncrash, Uppy would have no idea about what it was doing before, and you would\\nhave to re-select and edit your files all over.\\n\\n<center><img src=\\"/img/blog/golden-retriever/no-idea-dog-3.gif\\" alt=\\"Dog has no idea what he is doing\\" title=\\"Keep trying, buddy!\\" /></center>\\n\\nFor those cases, our Golden Retriever now comes to the rescue! It saves Uppy\u2019s\\nmemory (state) in browser cache with every move you make. This means that when\\nUppy suddenly crashes for whatever reason, our plugin will be able to retrieve\\nthis memory upon restart, and offer to resume where you left off. Sounds simple\\nenough right? So why hasn\'t anybody attempted this before?\\n\\nAs it turns out, it\u2019s tricky. For one thing, no other competing file uploader\\nuses tus, and resuming uploads without standardized and scrutinized components\\nis really leaving you with more problems than you\u2019re trying to solve in the\\nfirst place. But with tus, we are standing on the shoulders of a giant and need\\nnot worry about the resumability aspect of the transmission.\\n\\nSo then it becomes all about remembering what was going on with file selection\\nand uploading right before the crash. One of the big issues here is that because\\nof security reasons, Uppy is no longer allowed to access the selected files on\\nyour disk after a crash. Reasonable of course, but this meant that we had to\\ndeploy a number of workarounds that \u2014 while it may cause our inner purist some\\nupset - combined, now amount to a pretty sweet user experience for the majority\\nof cases. And in the end, that is what Uppy is all about: pleasing and\\ndelighting its users.\\n\\n<a name=\\"how\\"></a>\\n\\n## \ud83d\udc7b How it works\\n\\nIf you really want to know...\\n\\nBecause we cannot access the files that we were uploading from disk, we cache\\nthem inside the browser.\\n\\nIt all started with\\n[a prototype](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/237) by\\n[Richard Willars](https://github.com/richardwillars), which used a Service\\nWorker to store files and states. Service Workers are great for when you close a\\ntab, but when the browser dies, so does the Service Worker (in most cases).\\nAlso: iOS does not support it yet. So, we looked at Local Storage, which is\\nalmost universally available and _can_ survive a browser crash, but can\'t be\\nused to store blobs. We also considered IndexedDB, which _can_ store blobs, but\\nis less available and has severe limits on how much you can or should store in\\nit.\\n\\nSince all of these technologies came with specific drawbacks, which one should\\nwe pick?\\n\\nWhy, all of them, of course! By combining the three, they cover each other\u2019s\\ndisadvantages with their own advantages. Here\'s what goes where:\\n\\n- Local Storage stores all files state, without blobs (the actual data of the\\n  file), and restores this meta information on boot.\\n- Service Worker stores references to all file blobs in memory. This should\\n  persist when navigating away from a page or closing the browser tab, but will\\n  likely get destroyed after a browser crash / quit.\\n- IndexedDB stores all files that can reasonably be stored there, up to 10 MB\\n  per file and 300 MB in total (we are still debating reasonable limits). This\\n  persists until either the browser or Uppy decides to do a cleanup.\\n\\nNow when Uppy starts, we restore all meta information from Local Storage to get\\nan idea of what was going on. For the blobs, we try to recover data from both\\nthe Service Worker and IndexedDB. This goes a long way into supporting many\\ndisastrous scenarios out there.\\n\\nIn some cases (very large files or a complete browser crash), we won\u2019t be able\\nto recover the file, but we do have valuable information about it, such as the\\nname and a preview.\\n\\nOur current idea is that we could present the user with \u201cghost files\u201d for these\\nedge cases, and ask them to re-add such files. Here\u2019s an early mockup, but we\\nwould love more feedback on this:\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/blog/golden-retriever/desktop-ghost.png\\" alt=\\"Design mockup with ghosts\\" title=\\"Design mockup with ghosts\\" />\\n\\nFor the remaining cases, if an upload was already in progress before the\\ncrash/refresh, and especially if it was resumable (via [tus](https://tus.io),\\nfor example), Golden Retriever just picks up from where it all went south. Our\\nGolden Retriever will also clean up after herself: when files are successfully\\nuploaded, or you decide to delete them, they will be removed from all\\n\u201cpermanent\u201d storages.\\n\\n<a name=\\"try\\"></a>\\n\\n## \ud83d\udea6 Give it a try in alpha\\n\\nGolden Retriever already works \u2014 tail awagging \u2014 and feels like magic\\n:sparkles:, but it is also unstable, and hasn\u2019t been tested on all the different\\ndevices yet. We encourage you to try it out though:\\n\\n```sh\\ngit clone https://github.com/transloadit/uppy.git\\ngit checkout feature/restore-files\\nnpm install\\nnpm run dev\\n```\\n\\nA new browser tab with Uppy + Golden Retriever should open in a moment after the\\nlast command from above. The app entry point is in\\n`examples/bundled-example/main.js`, it rebuilds on change. Enjoy!

We are back with yet another Uppy release that contains some often requested\\nfeatures such as file restrictions and better file type detection, alongside a\\nbrand new Instagram plugin, UI improvements and more!\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## \u26a0\ufe0f File Restrictions\\n\\nSomething that a few of our biggest fans were asking for, is finally here!\\nHere\'s the gist of it:\\n\\n```js\\nUppy({\\n\\tdebug: true,\\n\\tautoProceed: false,\\n\\trestrictions: {\\n\\t\\tmaxFileSize: 300000,\\n\\t\\tmaxNumberOfFiles: 5,\\n\\t\\tminNumberOfFiles: 2,\\n\\t\\tallowedFileTypes: [\'image/*\', \'video/*\'],\\n\\t},\\n\\tonBeforeFileAdded: (currentFile, files) => {\\n\\t\\tif (currentFile.name === \'my-file.jpg\') {\\n\\t\\t\\treturn Promise.resolve();\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\treturn Promise.reject(\'This is not the file I was looking for\');\\n\\t},\\n\\tonBeforeUpload: (files) => {\\n\\t\\tif (Object.keys(files).length < 2) {\\n\\t\\t\\treturn Promise.reject(\'Too few files :(\');\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\treturn Promise.resolve();\\n\\t},\\n});\\n```\\n\\nBasically, there are two ways to set restrictions:\\n\\n1\\\\. Using the `restrictions` object in Uppy\'s core settings:\\n\\n```js\\nrestrictions: {\\n  maxFileSize: 300000,\\n  maxNumberOfFiles: 5,\\n  minNumberOfFiles: 2,\\n  allowedFileTypes: [\'image/*\', \'video/*\']\\n}\\n```\\n\\nTranslation: allow only images and videos of any type, a minimum of 2 and\\nmaximum of 5 files must be selected, 300kb or less.\\n\\n`allowedFileTypes` must be an array of strings with supported file mime-types.\\nAnything from\\n[this list](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml)\\nshould work, as long as Uppy is able to detect it (and Uppy promises to try real\\nhard, see below for details). Both wildcards `video/*` and specicifc types\\n`image/jpeg` are supported!\\n\\n2\\\\. Using the more advanced callbacks: `onBeforeFileAdded(currentFile, files)`,\\nwhich fires before a file is added and allows you to run whatever checks you\\nwish against either the single file that is about to be added or all files\\ncurrently selected / uploaded, and `onBeforeUpload(files)`, where you are able\\nto check stuff before proceeding with the upload.\\n\\nBasically, use the first option for the simple stuff such as limiting uploads to\\nimages or a maximum of three files. Use the second option for things like \u201cwe\\nneed users to upload 5 photos and an audio file, so we can make a short clip out\\nof it\u201d. Let us know if this suits your needs, we are all \ud83d\udc42ears\ud83d\udc42!\\n\\nAlso, a new `note` option has been added to the Dashboard, as a quick and easy\\nway to inform users about the restrictions you choose to set up:\\n\\n```js\\nuppy.use(Dashboard, {\\n\\tnote: \'Images and video only, 300kb or less\',\\n});\\n```\\n\\n<img className=\\"border\\" src=\\"/img/blog/0.17/restrictions-note.jpg\\" />\\n\\n## \ud83d\udcf8 Instagram plugin and UI overhaul\\n\\nYes, Instagram is now supported in Uppy, so you can easily import all of your\\ncat, dog and food pictures!\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wide\\">\\n  <img className=\\"border\\" src=\\"/img/blog/0.17/instagram-ui.jpg\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\nYou can try it live in the\\n[Dashboard example](https://uppy.io/examples/dashboard/).\\n\\nThe UI for all \u201cprovider\u201d plugins, which is the way we call Google Drive,\\nDropbox and other external services, have been revamped to make better use of\\nthe space.\\n\\nFiles are now selected, or added, on click/tap, rather than double click, which\\nis easier and also works on mobile. \ud83d\ude40\\n\\n<img className=\\"border\\" src=\\"/img/blog/0.17/provider-search.jpg\\" />\\n\\n## StatusBar\\n\\nThe Dashboard\u2019s StatusBar has been improved. First of all, even though it still\\ncomes bundled with the Dashboard like before, it is now a separate plugin that\\ncan be used anywhere, like with the Drag and Drop plugin or your own custom\\nthing. Furthermore, it now shows fatal upload errors in addition to the upload /\\nprocessing / transcoding progress. \ud83d\udcaa\\n\\nIn the Dashboard, you can now disable the StatusBar and/or Informer if you don\u2019t\\nneed them or want something custom, by setting `disableStatusBar: true` and\\n`disableInformer: true`.\\n\\nDetails: [#217](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/217)\\n\\n## Better file type detection\\n\\nWe\u2019ve added a [`file-type`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/file-type) module\\nthat helps with figuring out the file type by reading the first magic bytes of\\nthe file. If that doesn\u2019t work, we try to use the mime-type provided by the\\nsystem/browser, and if that is still a dead end, we attempt to figure it out by\\nextension. All in all, this leads to a more robust file type detecting\\nexperience.

Missed us much? :) We\'re chomping at the bits, at least, to tell\\nyou about our latest release. This one has been in the works longer than usual,\\nbut then again, it\'s also way cooler than usual, so let\'s get right to it.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Transloadit integration beta\\n\\nYes, you read that right! We now have an easily integrable\\n[Transloadit](https://transloadit.com) plugin. It was a big push indeed and we\\nowe a big debt of thanks to [Ren\xe9e](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop) for going\\nfully beast mode on this. The plugin is still in beta, but it works - and it\'s\\nawesome. That said, of course it is entirely optional: if you don\'t use\\nTransloadit, you don\'t have to bundle the plugin.\\n\\n<video alt=\\"Demo video showing the Transloadit upload plugin in action.\\" muted autoplay loop>\\n  <source src=\\"/img/blog/0.16/transloadit.webm\\" type=\\"video/webm\\" />\\n  <source src=\\"/img/blog/0.16/transloadit.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\nThe Transloadit plugin for Uppy handles creating an \\"Assembly\\" (a file\\nconversion job) before uploading files, and can optionally wait for file\\nconversions to complete before showing the uploads as successful, as shown\\nabove. Listen for the `core:success` event to respond to upload completion, just\\nlike you would without the Transloadit plugin.\\n\\nWe\'ll be adding decent documentation to the Uppy website soon, but\\n[here](https://gist.github.com/kvz/8ae07aa8c063c8e55abbc1580b50c8a4#file-uppy-demo-js-L117-L147)\\nis a quick code sample of how a Transloadit plugin integration would look like\\nalready.\\n\\n## More work on high-level React components\\n\\nSince the last release, we\'ve been exploring possibilities for an official set\\nof React components. Initially, we\'ll be providing component wrappers for the\\nexisting Uppy UI plugins, such as the [Dashboard](/examples/dashboard) and\\n[DragDrop](/examples/dragdrop) plugins. They aren\'t ready yet, but if you\'d like\\nto follow along with development, check out the work that has been done so far\\nin pull request [#170](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/170)!\\n\\n## DOM element in `target:` option, `uppy.close()` for tearing down an Uppy instance\\n\\nWhile laying the groundwork for the React component integrations, Uppy has also\\nbecome a bit friendlier towards being integrated with other frameworks and in\\nsingle-page apps. The `target:` option in each plugin used to work only with CSS\\nselectors, which was difficult to use if the plugin should be mounted on a\\ndynamically generated element. In 0.16, either a query selector or an actual DOM\\nelement can be passed in.\\n\\nThe new `.close()` method on the Uppy instance cleans up all of Uppy\'s event\\nhandlers and DOM elements. Useful when navigating away from a page with an Uppy\\nuploader in a single-page app, or when unmounting a React component that\\ncontains an Uppy instance!\\n\\n## Server time!\\n\\nWe got everything covered - front-to-back-end - so you can be sure we also got\\nsome things going on the server side.\\n\\n- parallelizing downloading/uploading remote files: start uploading chunks right\\n  away, while still downloading the file on disk. Even though the server may\\n  download files relatively faster, it is good to know that you don\'t have to\\n  wait out the download before the upload begins.\\n- Image thumbnails are now also shown for remote files.\\n- Automated tests have been added using the test library,\\n  [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/).\\n- Remote files are now deleted from local disk immediately after a successful\\n  upload.\\n\\n## And\\n\\nMultiple necessary chores (the kind you don\u2019t like to talk about at parties),\\nsuch as:\\n\\n- Replacing `babel-preset-es2015-loose` by the standard es2015 preset with\\n  `loose` option\\n- Merging the Tus10 plugin options with `tus-js-client` options\\n- We reviewed the uppy-server README to be more elaborate when getting started.\\n- The Service logo is now visible on the corresponding file in the Dashboard.\\n  For example if a file is being uploaded from Google Drive you would see a\\n  Google Drive logo easily identifying where the file is from.

In this post\\nabout Uppy 0.15, we have some exciting stories about `babel-plugin-yo-yoify`,\\nprogress event throttling, and new friends.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Yo-yoify for NPM-installed Uppy\\n\\nIn [`0.14`](https://uppy.io/blog/2017/02/0.14/), we added `yo-yoify` transform\\nto give Uppy some extra speed and eliminate `Function.caller` issues. As it\\nturned out, we [forgot](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/158) about\\nour Babel-transpiled `lib` version of Uppy that gets published to NPM \ud83d\ude40. We\\nthen spent some time creating a standalone version of `yo-yoify` that would be\\nable to parse `yo-yo` template strings before Babel-transpilation, only to\\ndiscover that there already is a\\n[`babel-plugin-yo-yoify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-yo-yoify)\\nthat not only does precisely that, but also frees us from jumping through a lot\\nof unnecessary hoops. It did\\n[have](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop/babel-plugin-yo-yoify/issues/9)\\n[a few](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop/babel-plugin-yo-yoify/pull/8)\\n[issues](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop/babel-plugin-yo-yoify/issues/11) at\\nfirst, but luckily our friend [Ren\xe9e](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop) was\\navailable to colaborate with us on this. Ren\xe9e has also agreed to join Uppy for\\na while to help us with other pressing issues. So, silver linings \u2014 bugs can\\nsometimes lead to new friends and wonderful beginnings. We are very excited\\nabout what this all means for Uppy in the months to come.\\n\\nUppy from NPM is now good to go and the issue has been completely resolved. You\\ncan update at: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/uppy>. And yeah, if you use\\n`yo-yo`, give\\n[`babel-plugin-yo-yoify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-yo-yoify) a\\ntry.\\n\\n## Pause & Resume Remote Uploads\\n\\nJust like with \u201clocal\u201d uploads, Uppy can now pause and resume remote uploads\\nfrom Google Drive or Dropbox (handled on the backend by `uppy-server` + `tus`).\\n\ud83c\udf89\\n\\n## Progress Throttling\\n\\nWhile working on pausing remote uploads with `uppy-server`, Ife discovered a\\nstrange bug: uppy-client would hang during the upload, after which the progress\\nwould immediately jump to 100%. After some solid Sherlock Holmesing, we found\\nwhat was causing it: uploads were happening too fast. This was leading to\\nprogress events being sent very, very often (like 300 / second), which trashed\\nthe interface rendering loop. We have solved this by\\n[adding throttling in tus-js-client](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/commit/9940f27b2361fd7e10ba58b09b60d82422183bbb)\\n(thanks Marius!) and\\n[uppy-server](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy-server/commit/936ad48e92631c45d123664900b9aabcf7a190fa)\\n(thanks Ife!). I would also very much like to take this opportunity to thank\\nmyself for\\n[fixing](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/commit/1d5f4404546420442deabc94df84bd3ec0677eec)\\n[it](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/commit/db32c6f4fd85420532f27f04920dbaf6d126ea9b)\\nin uppy-client too! :innocent:\\n\\nTo prevent \u201cjumping\u201d progress, numbers and text in StatusBar are now only\\nupdated once a second. Plus, we have switched to\\n[`prettier-bytes`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier-bytes), which adds\\nsome nice number rounding. Smooth as butter!\\n\\nTL;DR Uppy was simply too fast at uploading, so we had to shorten the leash a\\nbit!\\n\\n## Informer coming at you in full-color mode\\n\\nInformer will now be able to change the way it looks depending on the `type`\\nargument:\\n\\n```js\\n// (`\'informer\'`, `text`, `type`, `duration`)\\nuppy.emit(\'informer\', \'Connected!\', \'success\', 3000);\\n```\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/blog/0.15/informer.png\\" />\\n\\nThis supports the following `type`s: `info`, `warning`, `error`, `success`, all\\nwith their own colors!\\n\\n## Some other things\\n\\n- Multipart now treats all 2xx responses as successful and returns xhr object in\\n  `core:upload-success` event callback.\\n- That progress circle that you can see on each file in Dashboard has been\\n  improved on the inside: precise `circleLength` and\\n  `stroke-dasharray/stroke-dashoffset` calculation.\\n- Uppy-server returns uploaded file urls and sizes for remote uploads (from\\n  Google Drive & Dropbox).\\n- Provider plugins now have a loading screen, error screen and logout link.\\n  Breadcrumbs are also working again.\\n\\n## Release Notes\\n\\nHere is the full list of changes for version 0.15:\\n\\n- build: update dependencies and eslint-plugin-standard, nodemon --\x3e onchange,\\n  because simpler and better options (@arturi)\\n- build: fix `Function.caller` issue in `lib` which gets published to NPM\\n  package, add babel-plugin-yo-yoify (@arturi #158 #163)\\n- provider: show error view for things like not being able to connect to uppy\\n  server, should this be happening when uppy-server is unavailable\\n  <http://i.imgur.com/cYJakc9.png> (@arturi, @ifedapoolarewaju)\\n- provider: loading indicator while files from GoogleDrive / Dropbox are loading\\n  (@arturi, @ifedapoolarewaju)\\n- provider: logout link/button (@arturi, @ifedapoolarewaju)\\n- provider: fix breadcrumbs (@ifedapoolarewaju)\\n- server: refactor local/remote uploads in tus, allow for pause/resume with\\n  remote upload (@arturi, @ifedapoolarewaju)\\n- server: throttle progress updates sent through websockets, sometimes it can be\\n  overwhelming when uploads are getting this fast (@ifedapoolarewaju)\\n- server: pass file size from Google Drive / Dropbox (@ifedapoolarewaju)\\n- server: return uploaded file urls (from Google Drive / Dropbox)\\n  (@ifedapoolarewaju)\\n- server: research having less permissions, smaller auth expiration time for\\n  security (@ifedapoolarewaju)\\n- dashboard: basic React component (@arturi)\\n- core: experiment with `nanoraf` and `requestAnimationFrame` (@arturi)\\n- core: add throttling of progress updates (@arturi)\\n- dashobard: fix Missing `file.progress.bytesTotal` property (@arturi #152)\\n- dashboard: switch to prettier-bytes for more user-friendly progress updates\\n  (@arturi)\\n- dashboard: fix `updateDashboardElWidth()` not firing in time, causing\\n  container width to be 0 (@arturi)\\n- multipart: treat all 2xx responses as successful, return xhr object in\\n  `core:upload-success` (@arturi #156 #154)\\n- dashboard: throttle StatusBar numbers, so they update only once a second\\n  (@arturi, @acconut)\\n- dashboard: add titles to pause/resume/cancel in StatusBar (@arturi)\\n- dashboard: precise `circleLength` and `stroke-dasharray/stroke-dashoffset`\\n  calculation for progress circles on FileItem (@arturi)\\n- dashboard: don\u2019t show per-file detailed progress by default \u2014 too much noise\\n  (@arturi)\\n- website: blog post and images cleanup (@arturi)\\n\\nEnjoy!\\n\\nThe Uppy Team"},{"id":"2017/02/0.14","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2017/02/0.14","editUrl":"https://github.com/transloadit/uppy.io/tree/main/blog/2017-02-0.14.md","source":"@site/blog/2017-02-0.14.md","title":"Uppy 0.14: Responsive Dashboard, Standalone & Pluggable Server, Dropbox","description":"Hi!

By default, each UI\\nplugin ships with an English locale, and you can override any string with your\\nown, like so:\\n\\n```js\\nuppy.use(DragDrop, {\\n\\ttarget: \'.drop\',\\n\\tlocale: {\\n\\t\\tstrings: {\\n\\t\\t\\tchooseFile: \'Valitse tiedoston\',\\n\\t\\t\\torDragDrop: \'tai siirt\xe4\xe4 t\xe4nne\',\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t},\\n});\\n```\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/blog/0.14/dnd-fi.png\\" />\\n\\nAnd just like that, your Drag&Drop plugin now speaks Finnish! _Hyv\xe4\xe4 huomenta!_\\nThis feature is a work in progress, we are trying to find the sweet spot between\\n[bundling a whole bunch of strings in packs](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/8c6252933813af69c1b71ec4621a7fc14dfb3ab0/src/locales/pt_BR.js),\\nwhich might be redundant (i.e. if you only use the Drag&Drop, you don\u2019t need\\nstrings from the Dashboard), and making you choose or set language strings for\\neach UI plugin. We\u2019d love to\\n[hear what you think](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/42).\\n\\n## Misc\\n\\n- [yo-yoify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yo-yoify) has been added to our build\\n  setup in order to solve a\\n  [Function.caller / strict mode issue](https://github.com/shama/bel#note) and\\n  to make the app faster/smaller by transforming template strings into pure and\\n  fast document calls.\\n- By the way, Uppy\u2019s UI DOM is powered by\\n  [yo-yo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yo-yo). We like yo-yo for its\\n  simplicity, speed and small size, but sometimes there are issues, one of them\\n  being the lack of wide adoption. We are looking at\\n  [Preact](https://preactjs.com/), but are also quite excited about\\n  [Nanocomponent](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/nanocomponent).\\n- Progress events that were not being properly sent from Uppy Server as now\\n  fixed. As it turns out, this occurred because server uploads were happening\\n  too fast, before the client was actually able to connect to the server.\\n  :scream: Guess that\u2019s a good problem to have solved!\\n- We have recently added Uppy to\\n  [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/uppy) and we were very\\n  pleased with the warm welcome, we even made it to the front page a few days\\n  later. Let\u2019s hope it will help get more people excited about the project.\\n\\n## Release Notes\\n\\nHere is the full list of changes for version 0.14:\\n\\n- dashboard: use `isWide` prop/class instead of media queries, so that\\n  compact/mobile version can be used in bigger screens too (@arturi)\\n- dashboard: basic \u201clist\u201d view in addition to current \u201cgrid\u201d view (@arturi)\\n- dashboard: more icons for file types (@arturi)\\n- dashboard: add totalSize and totalUploadedSize to StatusBar (@arturi)\\n- dashboard: figure out where to place Informer, accounting for StatusBar \u2014 over\\n  the StatusBar for now (@arturi)\\n- dashboard: add `<progress>` element for progress bar, like here\\n  <https://overcast.fm/+BtuxMygVg/>.

Here\u2019s what\u2019s new in Uppy 0.12.\\n\\n## Dashboard: local mode and multipart uploads support in UI\\n\\nPrior to this release, we\u2019ve optimized the Dashboard for usage with multiple\\n\u201cacquire plugins\u201d, say Webcam + Google Drive. But sometimes all you need is\\n\u201clocal disk\u201d with drag & drop support, nice file previews and progress. And now\\nthe Dashboard UI works great with that use case out of the box. When you don\u2019t\\nadd (.use) any acquire plugins, it looks like this:\\n\\n<figure class=\\"wide\\">\\n  <img src=\\"/img/blog/0.12/uppy-dashboard-local.jpg\\" />\\n</figure>\\n\\nAlso (prior to this release), we\u2019ve built the Dashboard to work well with\\n[tus resumable uploads](http://tus.io). That\u2019s why you can pause and resume\\nindividual uploads, as well as all at once. But if you use an endpoint that is\\nnot yet ready for the future and upload resumability (here\u2019s\\n[how](https://github.com/tus/tus-node-server) to\\n[fix that](https://github.com/tus/tusd), by the way), the Dashboard UI will show\\nregular \u201ccancel\u201d buttons instead of pause/resume.\\n\\nDashboard is gradually becoming more mobile friendly too, but we\u2019ll be saving\\nsome of that stuff for the next release.\\n\\n## Server\\n\\nUppy server has undergone a quite a few changes, including the build setup:\\n\\n- We are using ES2015, transpiling to ES5 with Babel.\\n- Added linting, lint-staged, pre-commit all that good stuff.\\n- Added `npm run release` command that publishes releases for us.\\n- Google Drive is working again on the Uppy Server side.\\n- Refactoring, error handling and more minor improvements.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## And\\n\\n- The website now features a video demo of Uppy in action, check it out:\\n  <http://uppy.io>.\\n- Fixed a bug where the Webcam would continue to be active (green light on) even\\n  after the picture was taken \u2014 all good now.\\n- Improved import/require support for ES2015 and CommonJS modules. Basically, we\\n  don\u2019t recommend ES2015 spread imports as a default option just yet \u2014 no tree\\n  shaking in Browserify and Webpack 1. Both\\n  `import DragDrop from \'uppy/lib/plugin/DragDrop\'` and\\n  `const DragDrop = require(\'uppy/lib/plugin/DragDrop\')` are now supported.\\n  We\u2019ve added `add-module-exports` babel plugin that replaces `export default`\\n  with `module.exports` for backwards compatibility.\\n- Optimized dependencies a little: removed the ones we don\u2019t use, upgraded some\\n  that we do.\\n\\n## Release Notes\\n\\nHere is the full list of changes for version 0.12:\\n\\n- meta: write 0.12 release blog post (@arturi)\\n- core: figure out import/require for core and plugins \u2014 just don\u2019t use spread\\n  for plugins (@arturi)\\n- meta: create a demo GIF, showcasing Uppy Dashboard for the main page, like\\n  <https://zeit.co/blog/next> (@arturi)\\n- meta: update Readme, update screenshot (@arturi)\\n- server: add pre-commit and lint-staged (@arturi)\\n- server: re-do build setup: building at `deploy` and `prepublish` when typing\\n  `npm run release:patch` 0.0.1 -> 0.0.2 (@ifedapoolarewaju)\\n- server: re-do build setup: es6 `src` -> es5 `lib` (use plugin packs from Uppy)\\n- server: re-do build setup: `eslint --fix ./src` via <http://standardjs.com>\\n  (@ifedapoolarewaju)\\n- server: re-do build setup: `babel-node` or `babel-require` could do realtime\\n  transpiling for development (how does that hook in with e.g. `nodemon`?)\\n  (@ifedapoolarewaju)\\n- server: refacor: remove/reduce file redundancy (@ifedapoolarewaju)\\n- server: error handling: 404 and 401 error handler (@ifedapoolarewaju)\\n- server: bug fix: failing google drive (@ifedapoolarewaju)\\n- webcam: stop using the webcam (green light off) after the picture is taken /\\n  tab is hidden (@arturi)\\n- core: allow usage without `new`, start renaming `Core()` to `Uppy()` in\\n  examples (@arturi)\\n- core: api \u2014 consider\\n  [Yosh\u2019s feedback and proposals](https://gist.github.com/yoshuawuyts/b5e5b3e7aacbee85a3e61b8a626709ab),\\n  come up with follow up questions (@arturi)\\n- dashboard: local mode \u2014 no acquire plugins / external services, just DnD.\\n  ActionBrowseTagline component (@arturi)\\n- dashboard: only show pause/resume when tus is used (@arturi)\\n- dashboard: cancel uploads button for multipart (@arturi)\\n- dashboard: responsive design \u2014 stage 1 (@arturi)\\n- meta: write 0.11 release blog post (@arturi)\\n\\nThe Uppy Team"},{"id":"2016/11/0.11","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2016/11/0.11","editUrl":"https://github.com/transloadit/uppy.io/tree/main/blog/2016-11-0.11.md","source":"@site/blog/2016-11-0.11.md","title":"Uppy 0.11: StatusBar, research, https and API docs","description":"Hey everyone!

Another month has passed and we have just released a new version of Uppy.\\nHere\u2019s what we\u2019ve been up to.\\n\\n## Thinking about the future \ud83d\udd2e\\n\\nWe have been spending quite a lot of time thinking about Uppy\'s future and the\\ndirection in which we would like to take this project. Our primary concern is\\nmaking Uppy as flexible as possible as well as compatible with popular\\nlibraries, such as React and React Native. We also want to make it easy to port\\nUppy to any environments or ecosystems that are not officially supported.\\n\\nWe have done a lot of research. We created\\n[prototypes of Uppy React components](https://github.com/hedgerh/uppy-react) and\\nwe also created a new module that we like to call \\"Uppy Base.\\"\\n[`uppy-base`](https://github.com/hedgerh/uppy-base) is a thin module containing\\nreusable functionality from some of our plugins that can be used in any\\necosystem or environment, without being opinionated about the UI.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nFinally, we are also discussing using [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)\\nas the internal state management store within Uppy. You can see some drafts\\nunder the `src/experimental` folder (EDIT: this folder has since been removed).\\n\\nHave a look at the\\n[Uppy Base repository here](https://github.com/hedgerh/uppy-base).\\n\\nCheck out\\n[our Uppy React wrapper and components](https://github.com/hedgerh/uppy-react),\\nwhich are built on top of Uppy Base.\\n\\nFinally, we have played a bit with [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules)\\nand [CSJS](https://github.com/rtsao/csjs). We have also tried generating preview\\nthumbnails in Web Workers, as well as with\\n[Pica library](https://github.com/nodeca/pica).\\n\\nWe would love to hear feedback on all of this. Please join our discussion at:\\n<https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/116>\\n\\nYou are, of course, more than welcome to chime in on other issues or to open new\\nones!\\n\\n## Dashboard: refreshed look and new features\\n\\nIn an attempt to be brave and keep things simple, we have removed the dashed\\nborder from inside the Dashboard, rewritten its layout with flexbox, and tried\\nout a new\\n[blend-in-with-the-background-and-blur](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1199054/18763191/35d31ddc-80da-11e6-9a2c-c46388857135.png)\\nmode.\\n\\n<img alt=\\"Refreshed Dashboard UI\\" src=\\"/img/blog/0.10/dashboard-sep-27-2016.jpg\\" />\\n\\nUppy now also has the option to render the Dashboard inline on the page, instead\\nof the default full modal dialog. To try it out, set `inline: true` in options,\\nlike this: `uppy.use(Dashboard, {target: \'.myContainer\', inline: true})`.\\n\\nWe have also added a circular progress bar that shows total upload progress,\\ncombined with a pause all / resume all button, and an info panel that shows\\nspeed, ETA and status for all uploads currently in progress. So you\'ll have\\nsomething fun and useful to look at while you are waiting!\\n\\n<img alt=\\"Dashboard UI with global pause/resume buttons and a status bar \u2014 progress speed & ETA\\" src=\\"/img/blog/0.10/dashboard-pause-resume-sep-27-2016.jpg\\" />\\n\\nBe sure not to miss out on the new Copy Link button that appears after a\\nsuccessful upload, right where the edit button usually is. We know, that\u2019s\\npretty exciting! And it gets even better: when you click on it, the link is\\ncopied to your clipboard. Or, in less capable browsers, a window pops up with a\\ntext link, so you can copy it yourself. Bananas!\\n\\n## Google Drive UI improved\\n\\nThe UI for Google Drive has received a fresh new redesign. Check it out!\\n\\n<img alt=\\"The redesigned file browser UI for Google Drive\\" src=\\"/img/blog/0.10/google-drive-ui-sep-27-2016.jpg\\" />\\n\\n## Listen to events\\n\\nWe have finally begun to expose events on the `uppy` instance, so you can now\\nsubscribe to them and use them in your app. For example, in order to display an\\nimage in your UI after it has been successfully uploaded:\\n\\n```javascript\\nuppy.on(\'core:upload-success\', (id, url) => {\\n\\tconst img = new Image();\\n\\timg.width = 300;\\n\\timg.alt = id;\\n\\timg.src = url;\\n\\tdocument.body.appendChild(img);\\n});\\n```\\n\\nThere is also `core:upload-progress` to track progress and `core:success` for\\nwhen all uploads are complete. The\\n[event documentation](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/#api) is quite small\\nright now, we\u2019ll be adding more once we sort out the API.\\n\\n## But wait, there\u2019s more!\\n\\n- i18n strings now extend default en_US dictionary: if a certain string is not\\n  available in a language, the English string will be displayed.\\n- Updated readme: improved usage docs and CDN links. Check out\\n  [the new usage section](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/#usage) for\\n  yourself. Import, require or script tag? In any case, we\u2019ve got your back.\\n- Capabilities: we have added `capabilities` to the state.

This release features some changes that we\\nthink you will be very excited about. Let\'s see what\'s new!\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Ability to pause uploads, progress indicators & ETA\\n\\nThe most visible feature that has been added is the ability to pause and resume\\nfile uploads.\\n\\n<img alt=\\"dashboard UI with paused uploads\\" src=\\"/img/blog/0.9/upload-pause.jpg\\" className=\\"border\\" />\\n\\n<img alt=\\"dashboard UI with files uploading and a pause all button\\" src=\\"/img/blog/0.9/upload-resume.jpg\\" className=\\"border\\" />\\n\\nThe upload dashboard now contains more information about uploads, such as the\\ntime remaining until an upload is finished. We have also added circular progress\\nindicators to give better visual feedback on an upload\'s progress.\\n\\n## Remote file uploads\\n\\nRemote file uploading is now working again.\\n\\n## Informer interface\\n\\nWe have added a new `Informer` plugin (tested with `Dashboard`, should also work\\nanywhere else) that listens to `informer` events, like so:\\n\\n```javascript\\nbus.emit(\'informer\', message, type, duration);\\n```\\n\\nand displays a message bubble for a certain amount of time. It will be useful to\\nnotify you when the internet connection is (a licky boom-boom) down (or back\\nup):\\n\\n<img alt=\\"info: no connection\\" src=\\"/img/blog/0.9/info-no-connection.jpg\\" className=\\"border\\" />\\n\\nOr when Uppy has successfully uploaded your files:\\n\\n<img alt=\\"info: upload successful\\" src=\\"/img/blog/0.9/info-upload-success.jpg\\" className=\\"border\\" />\\n\\n## Webcam: Say Cheese!\\n\\nThe Webcam plugin can now take snapshots and add them to the file dashboard in\\nUppy\'s modal. We have also added Flash support for Safari/IE users. The UI has\\nalso been cleaned up in the dashboard. We have temporarily disabled video\\nrecording in order to focus on rolling out the snapshot feature.\\n\\n## Under the hood: UI refactors\\n\\nUnder the hood, we have made some changes to how the UI is structured. We are\\ntaking a more componentized approach. For example, the rendering of Google\\nDrive\'s UI has been separated into multiple smaller components that can be found\\nin the `plugins/GoogleDrive` folder.\\n\\n## Release Notes\\n\\nHere is the full list of changes for version 0.9.0.:\\n\\n- dashboard: informer interface: message when all uploads are \\"done\\"\\n  ([@arturi](https://github.com/arturi))\\n- dashboard: improve file paste \u2014 not really possible \u2014 no file names, weird\\n  API, Chrome-only <http://stackoverflow.com/a/22940020>\\n  ([@arturi](https://github.com/arturi))\\n- meta: add google demo account [@kvz](https://github.com/kvz))\\n- meta: Set up a Google testing account that people can use to try the demo\\n  ([@hedgerh](https://github.com/hedgerh))\\n- meta: write 0.9 release blog post ([@hedgerh](https://github.com/hedgerh))\\n- webcam: a barely working webcam snapshot & upload\\n  ([@hedgerh](https://github.com/hedgerh))\\n- metadata: Uppy + tus empty metadata value issue in Safari\\n  <https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/issues/41> --\x3e tus issue \u2014 nailed down,\\n  passed to @account (@arturi, @account)\\n- core: experiment with switching to `virtual-dom` in a separate branch;\\n  experiment with rollup again ([@arturi](https://github.com/arturi))\\n- core: figure out race conditions (animations not completing because file div\\n  gets re-added to the dom each time) with `yo-yo`/`morphdom`\\n  <https://github.com/shama/bel/issues/26#issuecomment-238004130>\\n  ([@arturi](https://github.com/arturi))\\n- core: switch to <https://github.com/sethvincent/namespace-emitter> \u2014 smaller,\\n  allows for `on(\'*\')` ([@arturi](https://github.com/arturi))\\n- dashboard: add aria-labels and titles everywhere to improve accessibility #114\\n  ([@arturi](https://github.com/arturi))\\n- dashboard: file name + extension should fit on two lines, truncate in the\\n  middle (maybe\\n  <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/measureText>)\\n  ([@arturi](https://github.com/arturi))\\n- dashboard: implement a circular progress indicator on top of the fileItem with\\n  play/pause ([@arturi](https://github.com/arturi))\\n- dashboard: refactor to smaller components, as discussed in #110\\n  ([@arturi](https://github.com/arturi))\\n- google drive: refactor to smaller components, as discussed in #110\\n  ([@hedgerh](https://github.com/hedgerh))\\n- google drive: add demo account ([@hedgerh](https://github.com/hedgerh))\\n- metadata: add labels to fields in fileCard\\n  ([@arturi](https://github.com/arturi))\\n- metadata: the aftermath \u2014 better UI ([@arturi](https://github.com/arturi))\\n- test: Get IE6 on Win XP to run Uppy and see it fall back to regular form\\n  upload #108 ([@arturi](https://github.com/arturi))\\n- test: refactor tests, add DragDrop back ([@arturi](https://github.com/arturi))\\n- tus: update uppy to `tus-js-client@1.2.1`, test on requirebin\\n  ([@arturi](https://github.com/arturi))\\n- tus: add ability to pause/resume all uploads at once\\n  ([@arturi](https://github.com/arturi))\\n- tus: add ability to pause/resume upload ([@arturi](https://github.com/arturi))\\n\\nWe hope you will enjoy this latest release.

You can read below for further details.\\n\\n## Including Meta Data\\n\\nWhile fetching your files, Uppy is now also able to supply some custom metadata\\nto go along with them. So far, there are three components in place for that:\\nCore API (`core:update-meta` event), `MetaData` plugin, and a new panel in\\nDashboard UI called File Card, which looks like this:\\n\\n<img alt=\\"metadata dashboard UI, editing file name, future size and adding description\\" src=\\"/img/blog/0.8/metadata-dashboard.jpg\\" className=\\"border\\" />\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nTo summon this panel, all you have to do is click the edit button on the\\nDashboard:\\n\\n<img alt=\\"metadata dashboard UI, editing file name, future size and adding description\\" src=\\"/img/blog/0.8/uppy-dashboard-ui.jpg\\" className=\\"border\\" />\\n\\nBy default, the only active metadata field is `Name`. However, if you want to\\nadd other fields you can utilize our new and easy to use `MetaData` plugin:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst uppy = new Uppy().use(Dashboard).use(MetaData, {\\n\\tfields: [\\n\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\tid: \'resizeTo\',\\n\\t\\t\\tname: \'Resize to\',\\n\\t\\t\\tvalue: 1200,\\n\\t\\t\\tplaceholder: \'specify future image size\',\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\tid: \'description\',\\n\\t\\t\\tname: \'Description\',\\n\\t\\t\\tvalue: \'\',\\n\\t\\t\\tplaceholder: \'describe what the file is for\',\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t],\\n});\\n```\\n\\nAnd just like that, we have added two fields: `Resize` and `Description`. All\\nmetadata is sent along with both [tus](http://tus.io) and multipart uploads.\\n\\n## Webcam Support\\n\\nWe have also added a basic `Webcam` plugin, which allows you to acquire images\\ndirectly from your own webcam. This is still a work in progress and we will be\\nimproving it in the next release.\\n\\n## Mime Types and File Icons\\n\\nUppy now includes a [mime-type](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mime-types)\\nlibrary that helps us figure out file types by extension.\\n\\nHaving proper file types also means that we need the right corresponding file\\nicons for the Dashboard UI. We have already added a few and we will soon supply\\nmore icons for audio, video, text, PDF and other common file types.\\n\\n## Previously on Uppy: File Previews, Remote File Handling, Accessibility and Acceptance Tests Stats\\n\\nWe thought it might be worth taking a moment to list a few highlights from the\\nprevious versions as well:\\n\\n- If a file you selected is an image, its preview thumbnail data URL will be\\n  generated and added to `file.preview` in Uppy\u2019s state. This URL can be used\\n  later to render a preview with any plugin. Currently, this is done by the\\n  mighty Dashboard.\\n- It is now also possible to select remote files in Uppy. Simply double-click a\\n  file from, for instance, Google Drive, and Uppy will then show it in a preview\\n  area.\\n- We have been doing some more work on accessibility: from now on, when you\\n  switch tabs in Modal, it will focus on the first input in that tab. We have\\n  also added proper labels and titles, and are doing more research in this area.\\n- Everybody likes to see stats. That is why, on our website, you can now view\\n  stats that show how acceptance tests are performing in various browsers. If a\\n  test is successful, that means Uppy will likely be able to load and upload\\n  files in that particular browser.\\n- The Dashboard UI is now way better looking and easier to work with. It\\n  replaced the old `Modal` plugin and it can accept files via drag & drop, local\\n  disk and paste (experimental, WIP). It has become our main source of truth and\\n  the basic acquire plugin for local files. The DragDrop plugin is still\\n  available as a lighter alternative.\\n\\n## Release Notes\\n\\nHere is the full list of changes for version 0.8.0.\\n\\n- core: fix bug: no meta information from uppy-server files\\n  ([@hedgerh](https://github.com/hedgerh))\\n- core: fix bug: uppy-server file is treated as local and directly uploaded\\n  ([@hedgerh](https://github.com/hedgerh))\\n- uppy-server: hammering out websockets/oauth\\n  ([@hedgerh](https://github.com/hedgerh),\\n  [@acconut](https://github.com/acconut))\\n- debugger: introduce MagicLog as a way to debug state changes in Uppy\\n  ([@arturi](https://github.com/arturi))\\n- modifier: A MetaData plugin to supply meta data (like width, tag, filename,\\n  user_id) ([@arturi](https://github.com/arturi))\\n- modifier: pass custom metadata with non-tus-upload.

We feel that it\\nis high time we gave you a look behind the scenes: what are we working on, and\\nwhy.\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/blog/uppy-begins/uppy-dashboard.jpg\\" />\\n\\nThe way uploading works has not changed in a meaningful way since the days of\\nour trusty old 56 kbit/s modems. Of course, files have gotten bigger and speeds\\nhave increased, but that is more or less all there is to say. If it were up to\\nus \u2013 and we hope it is \u2013 that is all about to change.\\n\\nWe at [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com/) are on a mission to change the way\\nthe world does uploading. To accomplish this, our first step has been to develop\\nan open protocol for resumable file uploads, called [\u2018tus\u2019](http://tus.io/).\\nFinally, that 2GB video upload from your smartphone doesn\u2019t have to start over\\nwhen your train passes through a tunnel! The protocol got\\n[Hacker News excited](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10591348) on several\\noccasions and is being deployed by, among others, our friends at Vimeo. Now that\\na stable version 1.0 of \u2018tus\u2019 has been released, it is time to put it to the\\ntest. A protocol without real-world applications is nothing more than a\\nmeaningless document, after all.\\n\\nWe are therefore excited to tell you about Uppy: the file uploader that will\\ncertainly fetch more than just your newspaper.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Why the need for another file uploader?\\n\\nIt is true, there are indeed already a good few file uploading solutions out\\nthere ([Dropzone](http://www.dropzonejs.com/), for instance, is quite good). And\\n\u2013 for the most part \u2013 they do their job. Nevertheless, they are quite limited in\\ntheir functionality:\\n\\n- You can drag and drop files from local disk, but uploaders that supports\\n  Instagram, Dropbox or Google Drive are scarce. The ones out there lock you in\\n  with vendors and are hard to customize for own use.\\n\\n- File uploaders are seldom mindful of the existence of encoding and processing\\n  backends, while the reality is that files often require some form of\\n  processing and that the end user would like to receive progress updates with\\n  regard to that.\\n\\n- None of the currently available file uploaders make use of the standardized\\n  resumability that \u2018tus\u2019 provides, which makes them less than ideal for\\n  handling larger files.\\n\\n- Lastly, we feel that the current solutions are sometimes dropping the ball\\n  when it comes to a polished user experience. We aim to fix that.\\n\\nAll in all, we think there is definitely some \u2018trouble at the old mill\u2019 here and\\nit\u2019s time to let Uppy take care of that!\\n\\n## Our plans for Uppy\\n\\nUppy will be a JavaScript file uploader that allows you to fetch files, not only\\nfrom your local disk, but also from places like Dropbox, Instagram, Google\\nDrive, webcams and remote URLs. It will have a modular, plugin-based design,\\nmaking it lightweight and customizable.\\n\\nCute on the outside, the core of Uppy is very robust \u2013 thanks to resumability\\nthrough \'tus\'. We are confident that Uppy will be able to send even the biggest\\nof files over the smallest of tubes.\\n\\nUppy will also offer first class support for accessing Transloadit\u2019s uploading\\nand encoding backend, making it incredibly versatile. Of course, these are all\\nultimately just plugins, and Uppy can just as easily be used with your own\\nbackend \u2013 meaning no need to pay any subscription fees.\\n\\nWe are intent on making the user experience as smooth and satisfying as\\npossible, in terms of both functionality and visual design. Uppy will have a\\nbeautiful, themeable UI and it will look \u2013 and work \u2013 great on mobile platforms\\nas well. While we hope that advanced users will love the customizable nature of\\nUppy, an ample selection of presets will also be there to make sure that novice\\nusers are not going to be lost in the woods.\\n\\nLastly, and this is a point of special significance to us, Uppy will be\\ncompletely open source. When Uppy is finished, you will be free to use it for\\nwhatever you like. Until that time, we very much welcome your ideas and\\ncontributions. There are still a lot of decisions to be made and this is the\\nperfect time to come and influence the end product.\\n\\nWe are going to work hard on bringing you the best file uploader possible and\\nwe\u2019ll keep you informed about the development process on\\n[uppy.io](http://uppy.io/). We can\u2019t wait for you to meet Uppy!\\n\\n> We were on the [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12109410)\\n> and [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/uppy) frontpages.\\n> Comments welcome there."}]}')}}]);
