Hi! Hope y‚Äôall have had great holidays! üéÑ Which reminds us, we still have a
gift for you ‚Äî and we even wrapped it in a package (npm). Look inside and you‚Äôll
find that Uppy 0.14!

‚ÄúBut wait‚Äù, you might ask, ‚Äúwhere is the 0.13 release that we have been waiting
for?‚Äù

Well, let‚Äôs just say we are superstitious like that. You won‚Äôt see us coding
under any ladders either! And we were also in the middle of the holiday season,
so we decided to call 0.13 ‚ÄúThe Release That Wasn‚Äôt‚Äù and skip it.

Let‚Äôs take a look at what Uppy 0.14 has in store for you.

<!--truncate-->

## Major Uppy Server Updates

**Express.js** We‚Äôve switched to Express from Koa. It‚Äôs more widely adopted and
supported, has larger community and better maintained packages, so we went for
it.

**Pluggable or standalone** Uppy Server can now be plugged into your existing
Express/Koa server app, but you can also still run it as a standalone server.
[See here](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy-server#run-as-standalone-server)
for further instructions.

**Smooth authentication** It used to be the case that when you clicked that
stylish ‚Äúauthenticate‚Äù \[with Google Drive] button, you were taken away from the
page, and things tended to get lost. That has now all been made silky smooth:
upon clicking the button, a fresh tab will open in your browser, which will take
you to the authentication page ‚Äì be it on Google Drive, Dropbox, or somewhere
else. When you are done, this tab is automagically closed, and you are back
where you were, authenticated, with all your remote files at hand.

**Dropbox plugin** Dropbox support made it into Uppy this release! üéâ
[Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju) rocks like that. (A shoutout here as
well to [Harry](https://github.com/hedgerh) for the initial work on Uppy Server
and the Google Drive plugin!) Why don't you
[give it a try](https://uppy.io/examples/dashboard/)!

What‚Äôs more, the client-side code of Google Drive and Dropbox plugins is slowly
being refactored into a generic provider view that can be shared among
all¬†services.

## Dashboard

**Responsive UI and more icons** The Dashboard now adapts itself to screen sizes
big and small. That includes `inline` mode, where you can set `maxWidth` and
`maxHeight` in options, like so:

```js
uppy.use(Dashboard, {
	maxWidth: 300,
	maxHeight: 350,
	inline: true,
	target: '#myUploadContainer',
});
```

We are not using media queries here, but have instead added a
`UppyDashboard--wide` CSS class, which allows for more flexibility ‚Äî your file
uploading widget can be tiny even if the screen is large.

When there is little space available, the file grid view that you have become
used to, will turn into a new compact list view.

<figure class="wide">
  <img src="/img/blog/0.14/dashboard-grid-list.jpg" />
</figure>

We are also adding more file type icons and trying to be smarter about detecting
them. We have new icons for video, audio, text, and PDF for you to enjoy.

**Total / uploaded sizes** Total and uploaded sizes have been added to the
StatusBar, allowing you and your users to keep track of all those bits and
bytes.

You can play with all of these new features on
[the Dashboard example page](https://uppy.io/examples/dashboard/).

## Per plugin locale settings

We have moved locale settings from global/core to plugins. By default, each UI
plugin ships with an English locale, and you can override any string with your
own, like so:

```js
uppy.use(DragDrop, {
	target: '.drop',
	locale: {
		strings: {
			chooseFile: 'Valitse tiedoston',
			orDragDrop: 'tai siirt√§√§ t√§nne',
		},
	},
});
```

<img src="/img/blog/0.14/dnd-fi.png" />

And just like that, your Drag&Drop plugin now speaks Finnish! _Hyv√§√§ huomenta!_
This feature is a work in progress, we are trying to find the sweet spot between
[bundling a whole bunch of strings in packs](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/8c6252933813af69c1b71ec4621a7fc14dfb3ab0/src/locales/pt_BR.js),
which might be redundant (i.e. if you only use the Drag&Drop, you don‚Äôt need
strings from the Dashboard), and making you choose or set language strings for
each UI plugin. We‚Äôd love to
[hear what you think](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/42).

## Misc

- [yo-yoify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yo-yoify) has been added to our build
  setup in order to solve a
  [Function.caller / strict mode issue](https://github.com/shama/bel#note) and
  to make the app faster/smaller by transforming template strings into pure and
  fast document calls.
- By the way, Uppy‚Äôs UI DOM is powered by
  [yo-yo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yo-yo). We like yo-yo for its
  simplicity, speed and small size, but sometimes there are issues, one of them
  being the lack of wide adoption. We are looking at
  [Preact](https://preactjs.com/), but are also quite excited about
  [Nanocomponent](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/nanocomponent).
- Progress events that were not being properly sent from Uppy Server as now
  fixed. As it turns out, this occurred because server uploads were happening
  too fast, before the client was actually able to connect to the server.
  :scream: Guess that‚Äôs a good problem to have solved!
- We have recently added Uppy to
  [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/uppy) and we were very
  pleased with the warm welcome, we even made it to the front page a few days
  later. Let‚Äôs hope it will help get more people excited about the project.
