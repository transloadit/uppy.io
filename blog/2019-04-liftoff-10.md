Today marks the tenth day in our 30 Days to Liftoff! **April 25** is still in
our sights as we work towards the **Uppy 1.0** release. The end of the working
week is almost upon us, but there's no sign of slowing down yet.

our project board as the team has been working on tasks at a steady pace. A
quick status update will give us a little insight into how things are going
concerning all things Uppy.

## In Progress

- [Alex](https://github.com/nqst), [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) and
  [Artur](https://github.com/arturi) are debugging the [flickering on Drag &
  Drop](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1400) that Chrome and Safari
  users suffer from. Fingers crossed for a solution!

- Artur, working on the React Native side of things, has impressively added
  [file previews and tested hashes with different file
  types](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/988). After some more testing
  is complete, he'll move on to releasing a new version of Uppy. In addition,
  the React Native team has reschedulded their pair programming session to
  Friday, so expect some pretty significant updates tomorrow!

- [Kevin](https://github.com/kvz) started working on the [new documentation menu
  structure](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1405) for the site and we
  can already show a [live
  example](https://5ca5233bfd8bcc00085152a8--uppy.netlify.com/docs/) of it. Take
  a look at the main differences below:

## Done

- If you've been keeping up with our posts, you might notice the navigator at
  the top of the page looks a little different than usual. That is because Alex
  has been on a roll and [updated the
  navigator](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1403) for our blogposts.

- [Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju)'s fix for [hanging instagram
  uploads](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1274) was merged into Uppy's
  master branch. One more bug squashed!

- One small chore was done by [Ren√©e](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop),
  involving [adding git to the Companion
  dockerfile](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1404), which was needed
  to install tus-js-client and ensure Companion could be deployed successfully
  on our continuous integration server.

While not strictly related to our Uppy 1.0 release, we have managed to reach
over 6000 commits to our master branch and 99 contributors in the [Uppy
repo](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy). We would like to give a huge thank
you to everyone offering their support!
