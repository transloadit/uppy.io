Uppy 1.22 (the spooky Halloween edition) adds a new Unsplash provider, Webcam
camera selector dropdown and a `maxTotalFileSize` restriction.

<!--truncate-->

## Webcam Camera Source

If your device has multiple cameras, you can now choose which one you want to
use (if you allow the
[showVideoSourceDropdown](https://uppy.io/docs/webcam/#showVideoSourceDropdown-false)
option).

## maxTotalFileSize

New `maxTotalFileSize` restriction makes sure the total size of all the files
selected isn‚Äôt over a certain threshold:

```js
const uppy = new Uppy({
	restrictions: {
		maxTotalFileSize: 104857600,
	},
});
```

## Unsplash

[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) is a popular website dedicated to sharing free
stock photography. With a new Uppy plugin you can search for ‚Äútrains‚Äù, ‚ÄúNew
York‚Äù or ‚ÄúHarry Potter‚Äù images and upload them where needed:

The plugin launches in beta, but you can already try it out by installing
`@uppy/unsplash` and upgrading `@uppy/companion` to the latest version (2.1.0).
