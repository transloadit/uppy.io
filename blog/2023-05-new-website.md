We are excited to announce that our new website, documentation and blog are now
live out of beta, ready for you to enjoy on [Uppy.io](https://uppy.io)! Let us
know what you think [on twitter](https://twitter.com/uppy_io).

The first iteration of the Uppy website was built by Artur and Kevin over 7
years ago, using [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) static site generator as a base.
It served us well, but over time Hexo got less maintained, our docs more messy,
and quite a few places were collecting dust.

About a year ago Merlijn set on a task to refresh the Uppy documentation
experience, rewriting most of the docs from the ground up, with everyone on the
team contributing in their area of Uppy knowledge.
[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) 🦕 was chosen as one of the top modern
tools for documentation.

Most of the plugin’s docs now explain when you should use it (and sometimes when
not), followed by how to install, tips and details and links to CodeSandbox
samples.

And for desert, we now have a swift website-wide search in the top bar, powered
by [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com), give it a go!

Enjoy the new [uppy.io](https://uppy.io)!
