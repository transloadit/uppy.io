Yesterday, marked the beginning of our thirty-day blog post challenge to keep
you updated on our preparations for **releasing Uppy 1.0 on April 25**. So here
we are again already!

<!--truncate-->

Our big coding speedrun towards for 1.0 starts April 1, so we are mostly busy
with tying up loose ends, busting issues, and planning our work ahead.

## Our roadmap for 1.0

With so much still to do before Uppy 1.0 is ready go, it's important that we
keep track of all the various tasks. We are doing this with help of an Uppy 1.0
project dashboard that we created in [Asana](https://asana.com). This lets us
see in an instant what everyone is working on and what the current status is on
specific tasks.

We currently have our tasks divided into five sections, which are: _Nice To
Have_, _To Do_, _In Progress_ and _Done_. The tasks in the _To Do_ and _In
Progress_ lanes (and of course those that are _Done_) are planned to make the
1.0 release. And if we have time on our side before the launch date, we'll also
try to get as many of the _Nice To Have_ tasks checked off as well.

We've discussed our
[Changelog](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#10-goals)'s
1.0 goals and tried to re-prioritize and assign work.

We didn't manage to fit all of those *To Do*s in the picture, but here is a
screenshot of what our board looks like at the moment:

Aside from planning, we've also been busy onboarding
[Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) so she can hit the ground running April
1st.

And tomorrow, we'll look at the *To Do*s in more detail, so we can get a clearer
idea of subtasks and who will do what, exactly.

That's all the updates I have for you today. See you tomorrow for
[Day 3](/blog/2019/03/liftoff-03/) of our 30 Days to Liftoff!
