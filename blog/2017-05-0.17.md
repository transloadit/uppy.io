Hi! We are back with yet another Uppy release that contains some often requested
features such as file restrictions and better file type detection, alongside a
brand new Instagram plugin, UI improvements and more!

<!--truncate-->

## ‚ö†Ô∏è File Restrictions

Something that a few of our biggest fans were asking for, is finally here!
Here's the gist of it:

```js
Uppy({
	debug: true,
	autoProceed: false,
	restrictions: {
		maxFileSize: 300000,
		maxNumberOfFiles: 5,
		minNumberOfFiles: 2,
		allowedFileTypes: ['image/*', 'video/*'],
	},
	onBeforeFileAdded: (currentFile, files) => {
		if (currentFile.name === 'my-file.jpg') {
			return Promise.resolve();
		}
		return Promise.reject('This is not the file I was looking for');
	},
	onBeforeUpload: (files) => {
		if (Object.keys(files).length < 2) {
			return Promise.reject('Too few files :(');
		}
		return Promise.resolve();
	},
});
```

Basically, there are two ways to set restrictions:

1\. Using the `restrictions` object in Uppy's core settings:

```js
restrictions: {
  maxFileSize: 300000,
  maxNumberOfFiles: 5,
  minNumberOfFiles: 2,
  allowedFileTypes: ['image/*', 'video/*']
}
```

Translation: allow only images and videos of any type, a minimum of 2 and
maximum of 5 files must be selected, 300kb or less.

`allowedFileTypes` must be an array of strings with supported file mime-types.
Anything from
[this list](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml)
should work, as long as Uppy is able to detect it (and Uppy promises to try real
hard, see below for details). Both wildcards `video/*` and specicifc types
`image/jpeg` are supported!

2\. Using the more advanced callbacks: `onBeforeFileAdded(currentFile, files)`,
which fires before a file is added and allows you to run whatever checks you
wish against either the single file that is about to be added or all files
currently selected / uploaded, and `onBeforeUpload(files)`, where you are able
to check stuff before proceeding with the upload.

Basically, use the first option for the simple stuff such as limiting uploads to
images or a maximum of three files. Use the second option for things like ‚Äúwe
need users to upload 5 photos and an audio file, so we can make a short clip out
of it‚Äù. Let us know if this suits your needs, we are all üëÇearsüëÇ!

Also, a new `note` option has been added to the Dashboard, as a quick and easy
way to inform users about the restrictions you choose to set up:

```js
uppy.use(Dashboard, {
	note: 'Images and video only, 300kb or less',
});
```

## üì∏ Instagram plugin and UI overhaul

Yes, Instagram is now supported in Uppy, so you can easily import all of your
cat, dog and food pictures!

  <img className="border" src="/img/blog/0.17/instagram-ui.jpg" />
</figure>

You can try it live in the
[Dashboard example](https://uppy.io/examples/dashboard/).

The UI for all ‚Äúprovider‚Äù plugins, which is the way we call Google Drive,
Dropbox and other external services, have been revamped to make better use of
the space.

Files are now selected, or added, on click/tap, rather than double click, which
is easier and also works on mobile. üôÄ

## StatusBar

The Dashboard‚Äôs StatusBar has been improved. First of all, even though it still
comes bundled with the Dashboard like before, it is now a separate plugin that
can be used anywhere, like with the Drag and Drop plugin or your own custom
thing. Furthermore, it now shows fatal upload errors in addition to the upload /
processing / transcoding progress. üí™

In the Dashboard, you can now disable the StatusBar and/or Informer if you don‚Äôt
need them or want something custom, by setting `disableStatusBar: true` and
`disableInformer: true`.

Details: [#217](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/217)

## Better file type detection

We‚Äôve added a [`file-type`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/file-type) module
that helps with figuring out the file type by reading the first magic bytes of
the file. If that doesn‚Äôt work, we try to use the mime-type provided by the
system/browser, and if that is still a dead end, we attempt to figure it out by
extension. All in all, this leads to a more robust file type detecting
experience. Personally, I‚Äôm just happy my Sex and the City üç∏ `.avi` files are
now recognized as `video` on a Mac!

Further details can be found here:
[#219](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/219)

## Extracting metadata from `<form>` inputs

If a plugin‚Äôs `target` is a `form` element, we are going to try to extract all
the data from that form‚Äôs inputs and add it as `meta` to Uppy‚Äôs state. That
`meta` is then merged with file‚Äôs meta when it is being added.

Uppy‚Äôs core options have received a new `meta` property, where you can define
some metadata from the start, as well as a new `setMeta` method that can be
called at any time.

See here for more details: [#238](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/238)

## More

- Added a `reset()` method that stops uploads, clears files and totalProgress,
  and restores things to the way they were on initialization, before user
  interactions [#226](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/226)
- Support for headers in Multipart plugin
  [#224](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/224)
