Shh, it's Sunday, Uppy is sleeping in today :sleeping: We'll be taking the day
off as well, as we gear up to go full throttle again in the morning. There's
still a lot to do before the **Uppy 1.0 launch on April 25**! In the meantime,
why don't you join us in letting sleeping dogs lie.

We hope this drowsy puppy inspires you to have a great and relaxing remainder of
your weekend. We'll have a lot more to share with you tomorrow, so see you on
[Day 7](/blog/2019/04/liftoff-07/) of our 30 Days to Liftoff!
