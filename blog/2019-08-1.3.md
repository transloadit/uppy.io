Hi there! We are back after a period of silence following the
[Uppy 1.0 release](https://uppy.io/blog/2019/04/1.0/) in the end of April. It
was pretty well received by the commnunity and press: we hit the front pages of
Hacker News, [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/uppy-1-0/) and
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/bhkx5k/uppy_10_your_best_friend_in_file_uploading/).
We then started trending and gained over 20,000 stargazers on GitHub, got
mentioned by
[Smashing Magazine](https://mobile.twitter.com/smashingmag/status/1097870169043546112),
[JavaScript Daily](https://twitter.com/JavaScriptDaily/status/1122935583603556352)
and [JavaScript Weekly](https://javascriptweekly.com/issues/434). It‚Äôs been a
crazy ride! We‚Äôd like to thank all our contributors and users for their
continued support.

It was not all self reflection and celebrations, though, in Uppy Remote
Headquaters‚Ñ¢ following the `1.0` launch. After some vacation time, we quickly
got back to work, releasing Uppy `1.1`, `1.2` and `1.3`. These updates address a
lot of issues raised by the community and the team.

This post highlights the most important and exciting changes from those
releases: accessibility and performance, thumbnails rotatation, new logger,
progress and uploader improvements, Robodog and Companion updates, new languages
and more.

## Accessibility

Our new team member, Evgenia, has been on a roll and together with Artur and
Alex, she has been working hard on improving accessiblity in Uppy. Evgenia has
come up with something called ‚Äúsuperfocus‚Äù, which makes sure focus stays on the
most relevant button or field in the current view. The `@uppy/provider-views`
layouts have been refactored so that checkboxes and labels are accessible. Focus
styles have also been improved.

</video>

Other notable accessiblity fixes and improvements:

- An ‚ÄúAdd more‚Äù caption near the + button has been added to the desktop version
  of Uppy
- ‚ÄúCopy link‚Äù & ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù links have been replaced with icons
- All SVGs are now not focusable in IE11
- Pasting works while we‚Äôre focused on buttons
- Focus is not lost when state is updated in filter in provider-views or when
  editing file meta
- Selected checkboxes now persist when moving between folders

‚ö†Ô∏è `@uppy/provider-views` translation strings have been moved from Dashboard to
Core. This eliminates a dependency of provider-views upon Dashboard
[#1712](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1712).

See [#1507](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1507),
[#1574](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1574) and
[#1656](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1656) for more details.

## Dashboard performance improvements

Ren√©e attacked performance problems in the Dashboard when adding many hundreds
of files. Previously, we naively rerendered the entire file list when _any_ file
had a change. Now, only the changed file rerenders:

Before:

After:

See [#1671](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1671) for more details. As
you can see, there are still some laggy interactions ‚Äî expect more improvements
in future releases!

## Logger

We‚Äôve added an option to supply a `logger` object with `debug`, `warn` and
`error` methods, so you can use a custom logging solution with Uppy. Check out
[the docs](https://uppy.io/docs/uppy/#logger) for more information.

In the future, past 2.0, the `logger: Uppy.debugLogger` option is going to
replace `debug: true`. The latter will be kept for backwards compatibility for
now.

‚ö†Ô∏è Since `@uppy/core@1.2`, the default logger has switched to `console.debug`
from `console.log` by default. You might need to change settings in your
browser‚Äôs devtools to see Uppy logs!

Versions of each Uppy plugin and Core are now also logged for easier debugging.

See [#1661](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1661) and
[#1640](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1640) for more details.

## Thumbnails rotated correctly

Before this change, when you added a file to Uppy from a mobile device, you
would sometimes see the preview image sideways. This was because we didn‚Äôt
account for EXIF rotation metadata when generating thumbnails with
`@uppy/thumbnail-generator`. But now, thanks to
[@Botz](https://github.com/Botz), we do! See
[#1532](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1661).

## Progress improvements

- The Status Bar now shows the correct total size of the upload when some files
  have already finished, instead of jumping down
  [#1685](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1685).
- Fixed an issue where progress could jump to bizarrely high values (like 1038%)
  while uploading files that don‚Äôt have a known size (e.g., pictures from
  Instagram) [#1610](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1610).
- We‚Äôve moved from the `prettier-bytes` package into `@uppy/utils`, and divide
  by `1024` instead of `1000` to justify `KB` vs `kB`
  [#1732](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1732).

## Drag and drop

- Drag and drop has been refactored internally in both the Dashboard and
  DragDrop plugins. This means a more robust and cross-browser implementation,
  with a fancy ‚Äúdrop files here‚Äù screen when you drag over the Dashboard.
- The `@uppy/drag-drop` plugin now renders an entirely clickable DnD area.

See [#1440](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1440),
[#1565](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1565) and
[#1633](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1633) for more details.

## Uploaders

- xhr-upload: we now send along global metadata when `bundle: true` option is
  set [#1677](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1677).
- xhr-upload: type and name are set from file.meta
  [#1616](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1616).
- aws-s3-multipart: added metadata support for S3 MultiPart
  [#1698](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1698).
- aws-s3: allows overriding of getResponseData()
  [#1647](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1647).
- aws-s3: prevents unnecessary delete multiparts request for completed files
  [#1650](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1650).
- aws-s3: do not extract keys from empty `fields`
  [#1569](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1569).
- tus: `metaFields` option has been added to the tus plugin
  [#1644](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1644).

## Localization

Thanks to our amazing contributors, Uppy now speaks: Arabic, Chinese, Dutch,
English, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Persian,
Portuguese, Russian, Serbian, Spanish an Turkish!

New translations are rolling in every month, but there are plenty more languages
out there that Uppy would love to learn. Please consider
[contributing your language](http://uppy.io/docs/locales/#Contributing-a-new-language)
as well!

We‚Äôve also added docs for locales ‚Äî how to use from NPM and CDN, auto-generated
list of languages that are supported already and an invitation to add more
[#1553](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1553).

Finally, we‚Äôve fixed an issue that could occur when adding files with names in
non-Latin alphabets. When adding a file to Uppy, it gets an ID based on several
characteristics, such as its size and file name. Previously, our ID generation
would ignore any non-alphanumeric characters in the file name, which could cause
the IDs for different files to clash. Now, those characters are worked into the
ID, so that multiple similar files with different non-alphanumeric names can be
added. See [#1722](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1722).

## Robodog

Robodog is an Uppy-based library that helps you talk to the Transloadit API.
Since 1.0, most of the updates have been bugfixes:

- `Robodog.dashboard()` and `Robodog.form()` now pass their options to the
  `@uppy/dashboard` plugin as advertised.
- `Robodog.form()` now supports the `triggerUploadOnSubmit` option from
  `@uppy/form`.
- `Robodog.form()` now supports localization of the ‚ÄúChoose files‚Äù button it
  adds in the default configuration.

## Build

- Ren√©e split our test runs into multiple jobs on Travis CI, so unit tests,
  end-to-end tests and other jobs all run in parallel. This lets us identify
  issues with failing builds quicker and also slashes total build times by half!
  üöÄ [#1709](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1709).
- Webdriverio, which we use for end-to-end testing, has been updated to v5. This
  improves a bunch of things and adds a lot of `await`s to our tests
  [#1675](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1675).
- Build dependencies have been upgraded: Babel to v7, Eslint to v5, Jest to v24,
  Typescript to v3, Postcss to v7
  [#1549](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1686).
- Fixed tags for docker build
  [#1579](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1579).
- New `uploadcdn` and sync version scripts
  [#1586](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1586)
  [#1600](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1600).

## Website and docs

- Added Community projects ‚Äî a page with Uppy plugins and integrations developed
  by the community [#1620](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1620).
  [Add yours](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/master/website/src/docs/community-projects.md)!
- Custom plugin
  [example](http://uppy.io/docs/writing-plugins/#Example-of-a-custom-plugin) ‚Äî
  now you have a reference to look at when writing your own plugin for Uppy
  [#1623](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1623).
- Added signature authentication to Transloadit example
  [#1705](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1705).

  [#1540](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1540).
- Updated AWS S3 Multipart documentation wrt CORS settings
  [#1539](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1539).

## Companion

Of course, we didn‚Äôt forget `@uppy/companion`. It‚Äôs getting more robust with
every release:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è We are now sending an `uppy-versions` header to Companion. Please see
  [how to avoid errors if you are using Companion but NOT as standalone](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1612#issuecomment-515117137)
  [#1612](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1686).
- Companion now returns mimetypes for Dropbox files
  [#1599](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1599).
- Added colors to logs [#1648](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1648).
- Changed oauth access token transport method
  [#1668](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1668).
- Companion now displays truer error during oauth failure
  [#1702](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1702).
- Not logging uppyAuthToken and not sending the error stack to client
  [#1663](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1663).
- Properly loading Instagram user name, removed deprecated dropbox field
  [#1651](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1663)
  [#1692](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1692).
- Return nextPagePath for Drive/Dropbox
  [#1652](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1652).

- Set upload filename from metadata during uploads
  [#1587](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1587).

## Misc

- ‚ö†Ô∏è form: now excludes own metadata when creating a new upload. There‚Äôs also a
  new option to append results to the input instead of overwriting
  [#1686](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1686).
- core: `relativePath` is added to local files when a directory has been
  dropped/selected. It is `null` for non-foldered files
  [#1602](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1602).
- core: using `uploadStarted: null` instead of false
  [#1628](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1628).
