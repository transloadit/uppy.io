Work hard, play hard! It's Saturday, so it's time for us to wind down and take
some time for ourself. Seeing as we won't have much to share over the weekend in
terms of progress updates, we thought we'd try to distract you a bit. Sit back,
relax, and enjoy this nice GIF, handpicked by our crew:

Just the thing we need to recharge those :battery::battery: to :100:, so we can
start making a dent on [Monday](/blog/2019/04/liftoff-07/) again. Hope you'll
have a good one! :kissing_heart:
