We have just released Uppy 0.8.0 and we can't wait to tell you more about it.
Along with various under-the-hood improvements, this release also contains some
very visible upgrades. You can read below for further details.

## Including Meta Data

While fetching your files, Uppy is now also able to supply some custom metadata
to go along with them. So far, there are three components in place for that:
Core API (`core:update-meta` event), `MetaData` plugin, and a new panel in
Dashboard UI called File Card, which looks like this:

<img alt="metadata dashboard UI, editing file name, future size and adding description" src="/img/blog/0.8/metadata-dashboard.jpg" className="border" />

<!--truncate-->

To summon this panel, all you have to do is click the edit button on the
Dashboard:

<img alt="metadata dashboard UI, editing file name, future size and adding description" src="/img/blog/0.8/uppy-dashboard-ui.jpg" className="border" />

By default, the only active metadata field is `Name`. However, if you want to
add other fields you can utilize our new and easy to use `MetaData` plugin:

```javascript
const uppy = new Uppy().use(Dashboard).use(MetaData, {
	fields: [
		{
			id: 'resizeTo',
			name: 'Resize to',
			value: 1200,
			placeholder: 'specify future image size',
		},
		{
			id: 'description',
			name: 'Description',
			value: '',
			placeholder: 'describe what the file is for',
		},
	],
});
```

And just like that, we have added two fields: `Resize` and `Description`. All
metadata is sent along with both [tus](http://tus.io) and multipart uploads.

## Webcam Support

We have also added a basic `Webcam` plugin, which allows you to acquire images
directly from your own webcam. This is still a work in progress and we will be
improving it in the next release.

## Mime Types and File Icons

Uppy now includes a [mime-type](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mime-types)
library that helps us figure out file types by extension.

Having proper file types also means that we need the right corresponding file
icons for the Dashboard UI. We have already added a few and we will soon supply
more icons for audio, video, text, PDF and other common file types.

## Previously on Uppy: File Previews, Remote File Handling, Accessibility and Acceptance Tests Stats

We thought it might be worth taking a moment to list a few highlights from the
previous versions as well:

- If a file you selected is an image, its preview thumbnail data URL will be
  generated and added to `file.preview` in Uppy’s state. This URL can be used
  later to render a preview with any plugin. Currently, this is done by the
  mighty Dashboard.
- It is now also possible to select remote files in Uppy. Simply double-click a
  file from, for instance, Google Drive, and Uppy will then show it in a preview
  area.
- We have been doing some more work on accessibility: from now on, when you
  switch tabs in Modal, it will focus on the first input in that tab. We have
  also added proper labels and titles, and are doing more research in this area.
- Everybody likes to see stats. That is why, on our website, you can now view
  stats that show how acceptance tests are performing in various browsers. If a
  test is successful, that means Uppy will likely be able to load and upload
  files in that particular browser.
- The Dashboard UI is now way better looking and easier to work with. It
  replaced the old `Modal` plugin and it can accept files via drag & drop, local
  disk and paste (experimental, WIP). It has become our main source of truth and
  the basic acquire plugin for local files. The DragDrop plugin is still
  available as a lighter alternative.
