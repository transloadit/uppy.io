Uppy 1.7 was released last December! This release added Hebrew translations, a
recording length timer for the `@uppy/webcam` plugin, and a collection of
improvements to Companion.

## showRecordingLength: true

When recording audio or video using the `@uppy/webcam` plugin, this new option
contributed by [@dominiceden](https://github.com/dominiceden) shows a timer in
the bottom right, so your users can see how long they’ve been recording for.

## Companion

The past months we’ve made some incremental improvements to Companion. We
patched an issue where Companion could sometimes output remote provider
authentication tokens into logs.

We now run Companion tests on Node.js 6 on each commit, in addition to Node.js
10, to make sure that we don’t break compatibility in a minor release. Node.js 6
support will be dropped in a future major release, and we recommend you upgrade
soon if you are still using it.

Uploading files from remote providers with the `@uppy/aws-s3-multipart` plugin
now uses the correct file name in your S3 bucket by default, instead of the
temporary filename that Companion uses internally.

The `getKey()` option for S3 now has a
[`metadata`](https://uppy.io/docs/companion/#s3-getKey-req-filename-metadata)
parameter, so you can use file metadata from the client to determine the name of
files in S3.

## Locales

The new Hebrew locale is available as:

```js
require('@uppy/locales/lib/he_IL');
```

Thanks to [@YehudaKremer](https://github.com/YehudaKremer) for the contribution!

In 1.7, we also fixed the naming of the Galician locale. The locale names follow
a `country_LANGUAGE` format. Previously, we used `es_GL` for Galician, which was
intended to mean “Galician in Spain”, but which _actually_ means “Spanish in
Greenland”! The correct way to refer to Galician is as `gl_ES`:

```js
require('@uppy/locales/lib/gl_ES');
```

The old `es_GL` name is now an alias for `gl_ES`. It will be removed in a future
major release, so we recommend updating your code if you were using the old
name. If you do it now, the migration will be easier once 2.0 comes around
