```js
const uppy = Uppy();
uppy.use(Dashboard);
uppy.use(Facebook, {
	target: Dashboard,
	companionUrl: 'https://companion.uppy.io/',
});
uppy.use(OneDrive, {
	target: Dashboard,
	companionUrl: 'https://companion.uppy.io/',
});
```

Try the live demos on [Transloadit.com](https://transloadit.com): import your
files from Facebook or OneDrive, and then:

- [Apply a watermark to an image](https://transloadit.com/demos/image-manipulation/text-watermarking/)
- [Convert an image to WebP](https://transloadit.com/demos/image-manipulation/convert-to-webp/)
- [Encode a video, extract 8 thumbnails and store everything in an S3 bucket](https://transloadit.com/demos/file-exporting/store-encoding-and-thumbnails-on-s3/)
- [Encode video for iPhone](https://transloadit.com/demos/video-encoding/encode-for-apple-iphone-11-pro-max/)
- [Create a single Zip file containing all uploaded files](https://transloadit.com/demos/file-compressing/create-one-zip-file-containing-all-uploaded-files/)

(Uppy demos are below the description and steps, under ‚ÄúLive Demo. See for
yourself‚Äù ;-)

As with Dropbox and Instagram, using the Facebook and OneDrive integrations
requires the client Plugins (see [here for Facebook](/docs/facebook/) and see
[here for OneDrive](/docs/onedrive/)), and also your
[Companion](/docs/companion/#Options) integration.

This is an exciting release for us, and we can't wait to get some feedback
(GitHub issues and PRs) on this! :)
