This release adds a long-awaited `uppy.setOptions()` API, allowing you to update
options of Uppy and its plugins on the fly. It also includes locales for the
Icelandic and Thai languages!

<!--truncate-->

## uppy.setOptions()

`.setOptions()` for Uppy and its plugins supports most options that can be
easily changed on the fly: `restrictions`, `locale`, Dashboard’s `note` and
`metaFields`, `disableThumbnailGenerator`, `showProgressDetails`, etc.

⚠️ Note that some options like `target`, `limit` and `id` cannot be changed on
the fly, as internal statefull things depend on them.

Here’s how the magic works:

```js
const uppy = Uppy({
	restrictions: {
		maxNumberOfFiles: 3,
	},
});
uppy.use(Dashboard, {
	note: 'You can upload up to 3 files',
});
```

Now, based on some condition in our app, we want to allow more files:

```js
// Updating Uppy options
uppy.setOptions({
	restrictions: {
		maxNumberOfFiles: 5,
	},
});
// Updating Dashboard options
uppy
	.getPlugin('Dashboard')
	.setOptions({ note: 'You can upload up to 5 files' });
```

Say, later on, the user changed their locale and we would like to reflect that
in Uppy:

```js
const fi_FI = require('@uppy/locales/lib/fi_FI');

uppy.setOptions({
	locale: fi_FI,
});
```

Now, Uppy will bark in Finnish! Hau, hau, hau!

[`uppy.setOptions()` docs](https://uppy.io/docs/uppy/#uppy-setOptions-opts) for
details.
