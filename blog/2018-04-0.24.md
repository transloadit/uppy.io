Uppy 0.24.2 brings a refreshed UI in the Dashboard and StatusBar plugins, a
synchronous `addFile()` method, a cancel button, style protections,
documentation on writing your own Uppy plugin, revamped XHR response handling
and tons of bugfixes.

## Refreshed Dashboard and Providers

As always, we are trying to simplify and improve the UI of Uppy plugins. In this
release, Dashboard‚Äôs design has been refreshed, check this out:

Meta editing screen:

Camera screen:

And more, check out the
[Dashboard example page](https://uppy.io/examples/dashboard/).

## A Cleaner StatusBar

The StatusBar plugin used to show a lot of progress details. This has been
simplified so that by default it will only show a percentage:

<img src="/img/blog/0.24/statusbar-2.jpg" />

But there‚Äôs an option `showProgressDetails: true` for both the StatusBar and
Dashboard (which passes it to StatusBar included in the Dashboard) to bring back
this detailed information, spread over two lines:

<img src="/img/blog/0.24/statusbar-1.jpg" />

```js
uppy.use(StatusBar, { ..., showProgressDetails: true })

// or

uppy.use(Dashboard, { ..., showProgressDetails: true })
```

We‚Äôve also added a handy ‚Äúcancel‚Äù button, which will cancel everything in
progress regardless of the type of the upload (wether uppy-server or local
powered, and wether tus-resumable or old school XHR/form uploads).

## XHR Response Handling

When the upload completes (regardless of whether it succeeded), a `response` key
gets added to the file. `file.response` contains a `status` and `data`
properties. `data` is the result of the `getResponseData()` option. The
`getResponseData()` function's signature is now:

```js
getResponseData (responseText, response) { }
```

This is what the default JSON parsing implementation looks like in the
`XHRUpload` plugin, but you can override it with your own:

```js
getResponseData (responseText, response) {
  let parsedResponse = {}
  try {
    parsedResponse = JSON.parse(responseText)
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err)
  }

  return parsedResponse
}
```

The `responseText` is the XHR endpoint response as a string. For uploads from
the user's device, `response` is the
[XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest)
object.

When uploading files from remote providers such as Dropbox or Instagram, Uppy
Server sends upload response data to the client. This is made available in the
`getResponseData()` option as well. The `response` object from Uppy Server
contains some properties named after their
[XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest)
counterparts:

- `response.responseText` - the XHR endpoint response as a string;
- `response.status` - the HTTP status code;
- `response.statusText` - the HTTP status text;
- `response.headers` - an object mapping lowercase header names to their values.

## Powered by Uppy

Uppy is provided free for the world forever. In return, we ask that you consider
keeping a tiny tasteful Uppy logo at the bottom of the Dashboard, so that more
people can discover and enjoy Uppy. This _really helps_ to grow our community
which will result in more issues reported, more contributors, more features
requested, more PRs merged, and a better Uppy for you to use tomorrow, for free,
forever.

If you don't want to do this indefinitely, consider doing this initially, just
to help us reach critical mass and get our _perpetuum mobile_ going.

But, Uppy is also free as in freedom. And so if you can't help our cause, set
`proudlyDisplayPoweredByUppy` to `false` to hide te Uppy logo.

## Server News

We occasionally get questions about the required servers for Uppy. Uppy does not
require special servers. You can use Uppy for free in the browser and let it
upload to your existing Apache/Nginx server. Sprinkle a few lines of HTML/JS and
that's it.

**If you want integration with Instagram** Dropbox and friends, you'll need to
run an 'Uppy Server' in the datacenter to help with OAuth secrecy and fetching
large files and uploading those, bypassing the client. No fun to have several
gigabytes pass through your mobile tubes - best let the datacenters sort this
out among themselves. That's what Uppy Server is for.

**If you want resumable uploads**, you'll need a <https://tus.io/> speaking
server.

You can run these optional servers yourself, or use the hosted variants provided
by our company [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com/) for üí∏. Transloadit also
adds a wide range of encoding/processing features.

Now that that's sorted out, let's see what we improved on the Uppy Server side!
We tackled a number of security issues:

- Fixed security vulnerability in transient dependency
  [#70](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy-server/issues/70)
- Auto-generate tmp download file name to avoid Path traversal
- Namespace redis key storage/lookup to avoid collisions
- Validate callback redirect url after completing OAuth
- Reduce the permission level required by Google Drive

Other non-security improvements are:

- Auto-generate Server secret if none is provided on startup
- We implemented a more standard logger for Uppy Server
- Added an example project to run Uppy Server on Serverless,
  [see](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy-server/tree/master/examples/serverless).

## Docs

- Uppy Server docs now point to a detailed write-up on how to run Uppy Server on
  Kubernetes (#706 / @kiloreux)
- An Uppy Server custom provider example has been added, so now it‚Äôs easier
  create your own custom providers.
- Added more useful events, i18n strings, fixed typos, and other polish.

## Other Fixes & Improvements

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **breaking** `addFile()`, `onBeforeFileAdded()` and `onBeforeUpload()` are
  now synchronous and have to return nothing or file objects to proceed, or
  false to abort; please check out the update docs for details:
  [onBeforeFileAdded()](https://uppy.io/docs/uppy/#onBeforeFileAdded) and
  [onBeforeUpload()](https://uppy.io/docs/uppy/#onBeforeUpload).
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **breaking** Most events now emit the whole `file` object instead of a
  `fileId`. So you can access `file.name` right away, for example, so you no
  longer have to fish for the file using its id.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **breaking** We‚Äôve added `postcss-safe-important` to our style build step,
  so now 90% of rules got `!important` declaration added to them. This is done
  to prevent page styles (especially global ones like from Bootstrap) from
  leaking into the Uppy widget. There are other solutions we are looking into,
  like iFrames and WebComponents, this is an experiment. Keep in mind that to
  override Uppy styles, you now have to also use `!important`.
- dashboard: ‚ö†Ô∏è **breaking** `maxWidth`, `maxHeight` options have been converted
  to `width` and `height`, because this makes more sense, `maxWidth` and
  `maxHeight` are actually `100%`.
- There is now an option `showLinkToFileUploadResult: false` to disable linking
  to the upload result in Dashboard UI.
- We are now using the image time and date as a file name in Instagram, instead
  of a generic file id.
- The URL plugin now checks for HTTP(S) protocol, and adds HTTP by default if no
  protocol is present.
- It‚Äôs now possible to override `<DashboardModal />` React component‚Äôs target
  prop.
- Provider views now have `showFilter` and `showBreadcrumbs` options, those are
  `false` for the Instagram plugin, for example.
- Uppy Server to Client communication has been refactored into `Provider` and
  `Request` modules. `Request` can be used when a simple request needs to be
  made to Uppy Server, like in the URL plugin. `Provider` is used for more
  complex implementations shared between Google Drive and Instagram, for
  example.

Finally, we‚Äôve added a Transloadit example to the website,
[check it out](https://uppy.io/examples/transloadit/).

Have fun,

The Uppy Team
