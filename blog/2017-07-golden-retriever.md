**TL;DR:** We're on a mission to improve file uploading on the web. We released
[tus](https://tus.io): the open protocol for resumable file uploads, as well as
Uppy: the next open source file uploader for web browsers. Uppy uses tus, which
makes it resilient to poor network conditions and crashing servers. Today we‚Äôre
launching an Uppy feature that also makes it resilient to browser crashes, which
we believe is an industry first. We‚Äôre sharing a quick
[demo](/blog/2017/07/golden-retriever/#demo) video, a bit of
[background](/blog/2017/07/golden-retriever/#uppy),
[how](/blog/2017/07/golden-retriever/#how) exactly we achieved this, and how you
can [try](/blog/2017/07/golden-retriever/#try) it yourself.

\*\*\*

Don‚Äôt you just hate it when you‚Äôre about to share the perfect photos from your
trip to Iceland, and halfway through, your cat jumps on the keyboard and trashes
your browser? Or the battery in your laptop dies? Or you accidentally close the
tab or navigate away? We hate that too!

If action games have had checkpoints since 1687 ‚Äî why can‚Äôt file uploaders?
Well, as it turns out, they can! We found a way to get those Iceland pics into
the hands of your loved ones with near-zero levels of frustration, even after a
dreaded Blue Screen of Death! (if that is still a thing ;)

## Demo

First off, let‚Äôs show you a demo üìπ of Uppy surviving a browser crash and
picking up right where we left it:

## Uppy?

For those of you who are new here, Uppy is the next-gen open source file
uploader for the web. It is made by Transloadit and thus it works great with
their uploading & encoding platform ‚Äî but it also works great without! Simply
add Uppy JavaScript to your website, deploy your own tusd/Node.js/Apache/Nginx
server, and be on your way. Add
[uppy-server](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy-server), and your users will
be able to pick files from remote sources like Dropbox and Instagram. Uppy‚Äôs
focus is on the modern web, and we go through extreme lengths to achieve the
smoothest of user experiences, and the most durable of reliabilities. üôÉ

## Hacking trip

Our core team is spread across three continents and five cities, and most of us
have never met in person, with the majority of communication happening in GitHub
and Slack. Just last week, we got together in Berlin for a crazy week of pink
limo rides, Indian food and Mario Kart 64. More on that on the
[Transloadit blog](https://transloadit.com/blog/2017/08/team-meetup-2017/).

While enjoying some world-famous-in-Germany ‚ÄúFlammkuchen‚Äù, we were thinking
about even more ways to make file uploading better (yes, we really can‚Äôt stop
thinking about that). We then sat together in one room for a few days of hacking
and came up with something neat.

## The Golden Retriever

Uppy has a new friend to play with. Meet the Golden Retriever, our file recovery
plugin:

<center><img src="/img/blog/golden-retriever/catch-fail-2.gif" alt="Golden Retriever failing to catch something" title="Good try, girl!" /></center>

As you can see, we‚Äôre not yet fully done with training her, but we‚Äôre getting
there! üòÑ

But wait, we can hear you think, didn't [tus.io](https://tus.io) already make
resumable uploads possible? Yes indeed, and it does an awesome job at recovering
from poor network conditions. However, if your browser suddenly decided to
crash, Uppy would have no idea about what it was doing before, and you would
have to re-select and edit your files all over.

<center><img src="/img/blog/golden-retriever/no-idea-dog-3.gif" alt="Dog has no idea what he is doing" title="Keep trying, buddy!" /></center>

For those cases, our Golden Retriever now comes to the rescue! It saves Uppy‚Äôs
memory (state) in browser cache with every move you make. This means that when
Uppy suddenly crashes for whatever reason, our plugin will be able to retrieve
this memory upon restart, and offer to resume where you left off. Sounds simple
enough right? So why hasn't anybody attempted this before?

As it turns out, it‚Äôs tricky. For one thing, no other competing file uploader
uses tus, and resuming uploads without standardized and scrutinized components
is really leaving you with more problems than you‚Äôre trying to solve in the
first place. But with tus, we are standing on the shoulders of a giant and need
not worry about the resumability aspect of the transmission.

So then it becomes all about remembering what was going on with file selection
and uploading right before the crash. One of the big issues here is that because
of security reasons, Uppy is no longer allowed to access the selected files on
your disk after a crash. Reasonable of course, but this meant that we had to
deploy a number of workarounds that ‚Äî while it may cause our inner purist some
upset - combined, now amount to a pretty sweet user experience for the majority
of cases. And in the end, that is what Uppy is all about: pleasing and
delighting its users.

<a name="how"></a>

## üëª How it works

If you really want to know...

Because we cannot access the files that we were uploading from disk, we cache
them inside the browser.

It all started with
[a prototype](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/237) by
[Richard Willars](https://github.com/richardwillars), which used a Service
Worker to store files and states. Service Workers are great for when you close a
tab, but when the browser dies, so does the Service Worker (in most cases).
Also: iOS does not support it yet. So, we looked at Local Storage, which is
almost universally available and _can_ survive a browser crash, but can't be
used to store blobs. We also considered IndexedDB, which _can_ store blobs, but
is less available and has severe limits on how much you can or should store in
it.

Since all of these technologies came with specific drawbacks, which one should
we pick?

Why, all of them, of course! By combining the three, they cover each other‚Äôs
disadvantages with their own advantages. Here's what goes where:

- Local Storage stores all files state, without blobs (the actual data of the
  file), and restores this meta information on boot.
- Service Worker stores references to all file blobs in memory. This should
  persist when navigating away from a page or closing the browser tab, but will
  likely get destroyed after a browser crash / quit.
- IndexedDB stores all files that can reasonably be stored there, up to 10 MB
  per file and 300 MB in total (we are still debating reasonable limits). This
  persists until either the browser or Uppy decides to do a cleanup.

Now when Uppy starts, we restore all meta information from Local Storage to get
an idea of what was going on. For the blobs, we try to recover data from both
the Service Worker and IndexedDB. This goes a long way into supporting many
disastrous scenarios out there.

In some cases (very large files or a complete browser crash), we won‚Äôt be able
to recover the file, but we do have valuable information about it, such as the
name and a preview.

Our current idea is that we could present the user with ‚Äúghost files‚Äù for these
edge cases, and ask them to re-add such files. Here‚Äôs an early mockup, but we
would love more feedback on this:

<img src="/img/blog/golden-retriever/desktop-ghost.png" alt="Design mockup with ghosts" title="Design mockup with ghosts" />

For the remaining cases, if an upload was already in progress before the
crash/refresh, and especially if it was resumable (via [tus](https://tus.io),
for example), Golden Retriever just picks up from where it all went south. Our
Golden Retriever will also clean up after herself: when files are successfully
uploaded, or you decide to delete them, they will be removed from all
‚Äúpermanent‚Äù storages.

## üö¶ Give it a try in alpha

Golden Retriever already works ‚Äî tail awagging ‚Äî and feels like magic
:sparkles:, but it is also unstable, and hasn‚Äôt been tested on all the different
devices yet. We encourage you to try it out though:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/transloadit/uppy.git
git checkout feature/restore-files
npm install
npm run dev
```

A new browser tab with Uppy + Golden Retriever should open in a moment after the
last command from above. The app entry point is in
`examples/bundled-example/main.js`, it rebuilds on change. Enjoy! And please
give your feedback in the [#268](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/268)
