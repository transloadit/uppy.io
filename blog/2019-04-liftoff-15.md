:musical_note: Woah, we're halfway there! Take our paw, we'll make it we swear!
:notes: That's fifteen down and fifteen more to go. Great to have you along for
the ride as we move ever closer towards **launching Uppy 1.0 on April 25**.

Let's see what is Uppy today!

## Weekly project board update

We had our weekly call yesterday, during which we re-evaluated the Uppy 1.0
project board. We were able to move a few tasks to the _Done_ lane and got some
new tasks _In Progress_. One of the features we're ready to start working on -
which I am particularly interested in - is language pack support. Uppy 1.0 might
be coming out in your local language! While we only have the capacity within our
team to take care of a select few languages (English, French, Russian,
Ukrainian, German, and Dutch) we will support as many as possible and hope that
the community will add many more.

Here is a view of what our Asana board looks like this week:

## Done

- [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) investigated an
  [issue](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1400#issuecomment-481039845)
  concerning a bug in Webkit browsers that resulted in the window blinking
  frequently.

- [Samuel](https://github.com/samuelayo) added another
  [example](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1389) for using Uppy with
  XHR uploads to a PHP backend.

## In Progress

- [Ren√©e](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop) is working on the Robodog Dashboard,
  so that it can also be depicted right inside the webpage, instead of showing
  as a modal popup window.

- Evgenia is focused on improving accessibility together with
  [Alex](https://github.com/nqst), who found many issues that we still need to
  fix in this area.

- [Artur](https://github.com/arturi) is currently working on a React Native
  example UI. We will update you once it is ready!

- Alex is also still actively working on making design improvements for Uppy.
  You can follow his progress
  [here](https://github.com/nqst/uppy/commits/design-facelift).

And that's Day 15! Tyler will be here again
[tomorrow](/blog/2019/04/liftoff-16/) to give you more updates on our launch
preparations. Subscribe via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/uppy_io) or
