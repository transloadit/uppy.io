**Uppy is [featured on Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/uppy-io)!
To our fellow hunters: welcome! Quick intro: Uppy is the next open source file
uploader for web browsers. We're very close to launching 1.0 and would love to
get your feedback in, leave your thoughts on Product Hunt or start a discussion
below.**

Hi all! It‚Äôs New Year and Christmas time, and this year Santa is brining you
Uppy `0.22` üéÅ This release packs a lot of neat stuff, but it also breaks things
in quite a few places, so please read on.

And, if you are celebrating, happy holidays from the Uppy Team! üéÑ

## Preact and JSX

We‚Äôve been happy using `yo-yo` and `hyperx` template strings in our views for
quite a while, but decided to try something more stable. Preact has most of the
great ideas of React, plus smaller file size as well as a few good ideas of its
own.

All views have been refactored to utilize JSX. We actually liked hyperx a lot,
but JSX has better tooling and syntax highlighting support. It also seems to be
the standard in the React community.

See [#451 PR](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/451) for details on why
we switched and discussion around the process.

## Core and plugins refactor

- **‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking** We‚Äôve renamed the `core` object to `uppy` in plugins. So
  instead of `this.core.state` we now use `this.uppy.state`.
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking** Events have been renamed to remove the `core:` prefix. So
  `core:success` becomes just `success`, and this also results in now having
  `error`, `upload-started` and so on. Prefixed event names are used for
  plugin-specific event sometimes, like `dashboard:file-card`.
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking** CSS class names have been altered to use the `uppy-`
  namespace, so `.UppyDashboard-files` becomes `.uppy-Dashboard-files` and so
  on.
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking** `getMetaFromForm` was removed in favor of the new `Form`
  plugin (see below).
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking** `MetaData` plugin was removed in favor of the `metaFields`
  option in Dashboard, [see docs](https://uppy.io/docs/dashboard/#metaFields)
  for more details.
- Plugins now use `this.el` to refer to their UI element instead of
  `this.target`.
- `setPluginState` and `getPluginState` are now used in Providers.

## Refreshed Dashboard UI

- File cards are simpler, we‚Äôve removed the excess white backgrounds, improved
  the remove icon, reduced paddings, added slight shadows.
- Cicular upload button in the Dashboard has been moved to the StatusBar. It‚Äôs
  also not circular anymore, and there‚Äôs no cloud icon. Plain and simple.
- Redesigned ‚Äúretry‚Äù and ‚Äúadd +1 file‚Äù buttons.
- Added `metaFields` option: an array of settings for UI field objects, which
  previousely lived in a separate `MetaData` plugin:
  `{ id: 'caption', name: 'Caption', placeholder: 'describe what the image is about' }`,
  [see docs](https://uppy.io/docs/dashboard/#metaFields) for more details.

See [#434 PR](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/451) for more screenshots
and details.

## Select multiple files in providers

Thanks to [@sadovnychyi](https://github.com/sadovnychyi), you can now select
multiple files from remote providers like Google Drive and Instagram. You can
also select folders, and even range of files by holding `shift` key when
clicking on first and last item in range.

## Stores

As you know, internally Uppy uses its own simple state management system with
`getState` and `setState` methods. In previous releases we‚Äôve added support for
Redux via a plugin called `Redux`, which mirrors all Uppy state to your Redux
application‚Äôs state, and a plugin called `ReduxDevTools` that connects to Redux
DevTools and enables all the cool time traveling stuff.

We are excited to tell you that this release makes state management even more
flexible by bringing support for external stores! Here‚Äôs a quote from the docs:

> By default, Uppy stores its internal state in an object.
>
> If your app uses a state management library such as Redux, it can be useful to
> have Uppy store its state there instead‚Äîthat way, you could write custom
> uploader UI components in the same way as the other components in the
> application.

Here‚Äôs how that works:

```js
const { createStore } = require('redux')
const ReduxStore = require('uppy/lib/store/ReduxStore')

const reducer = combineReducers({
  ...reducers,
  uppy: ReduxStore.reducer
})
const store = createStore(reducer)

const uppy = Uppy({
  store: ReduxStore({
    store: store // That's a lot of stores!
  })
})
...
```

Now Uppy will use your app‚Äôs Redux store instead of its own, so you have a
‚Äúsingle source of truth‚Äù üîÆ

Read [more on stores](https://uppy.io/docs/guides/custom-stores/) in docs.

## Form

`Form` is a new plugin that can be used in conjunction with any other. Here‚Äôs
what it does:

1. Acquires metadata from a `<form>` element of your choosing before the upload
   starts in Uppy.
2. Injects result array of succesful and failed files back into the form.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking** With this plugin we‚Äôve deprecated `getMetaFromForm` option that
used to be in all acquire plugins like Dashboard and DragDrop. Now you can just
use `Form`.

```js
uppy.use(Form, {
	target: '#my-form',
});
```

Read [more about the Form plugin](https://uppy.io/docs/form/) in docs.

## Encoding support in GoldenRetriever

Our browser crash / page refresh restore plugin `GoldenRetriever` (read
[more about it](https://uppy.io/docs/golden-retriever/)) now supports correctly
restoring [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com) assemblies!

Also, we‚Äôve fixed restoring from paused state. Now uploads will remain paused
and not get out of sync.

## Type-safe Server

Uppy Server now uses TypeScript to do some type checking at compile time. This
helps spot some otherwise easy to miss runtime bugs. While the project‚Äôs source
is still written in JavaScript, the use of
[JSDoc specifications is leveraged by TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Type-Checking-JavaScript-Files)
to detect data types and mistakes with that, within the project.

Thanks to this approach a number of hidden bugs have already been identified and
fixed, and it also makes Uppy Server very well documented. :)

## And there‚Äôs more

- New `setFileState` method as a nice shorthand to update file-specific state.
- Added more extensions for mimetype detection.
- More plugin documentation üëç
- Misc bugs fixes and improvements in Webcam, Dashboard, Provider, so things
  should be more stable all around.
- Added an option to limit simultaneous uploads in XHRUpload.
- Fixed remote server error handler for uppy-server.
- Added [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) to uppy-server to aid vulnerability detection.
