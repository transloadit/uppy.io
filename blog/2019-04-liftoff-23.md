Hello and welcome to Day 23 of our '30 Days to Liftoff' blog post challenge. The
launch date for **Uppy 1.0** is still set for **April the 25th** and a lot of
work is ongoing to make it happen. Let's take a look at the updates for today!

- [Artur](https://github.com/arturi) and [Kevin](https://github.com/kvz)
  **finished** the implementation of
  [language packs](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1443) so that you
  can now display Uppy in your (user's) local Language. Here is a quick example
  on how it is intended for use:

```js
// npm install @uppy/locales --save
const russianLocale = require('@uppy/locales/lib/ru_RU');

const uppy = Uppy({
	locale: russianLocale,
});
```

and if you'd use the CDN version of Uppy (instead of bundling and hosting
yourself:

```html
<script src="https://releases.transloadit.com/uppy/v0.30.5/uppy.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://releases.transloadit.com/uppy/v0.30.5/locales/ru_RU.min.js"></script>
<script>
var uppy = Uppy.Core({
  locale: Uppy.locales.ru_RU
})
<script>
```

While the new locale packs weren't finished, we had to reject updates to the old
locales, and quickly became outdated for which we are very sorry. To all
language contributors, we hope you can forgive us, and that you're willing to
translate the
[updated en_US locale](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/master/packages/%40uppy/locales/src/en_US.js)
to your own language! This time we promise your contributions will make it to
1.0!

- [Alex](https://github.com/nqst) continues to work on a
  [new design for the uppy.io website](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1452).

- [Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju) finished updating Companion to
  report [better progress](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1454) when
  it's downloading something that it needs to upload to an XHR target.

- [Ren√©e](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop) is working on error reporting for
  the Transloadit plugin as mentioned yesterday, which notifies us of
  connectivity problems when they occur.

- [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) continues her work on browser
  compatibility for dropping or pasting URLs.

On that note, Day 23 of our thirty-day challenge comes to an end. Tomorrow looks
like it will be another exciting day, so don't hesitate to keep checking up on
us via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/uppy_io) or
