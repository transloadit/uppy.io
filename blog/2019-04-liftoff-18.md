Hi! You're reading our '30 Days to Liftoff' blog post challenge about the
**launch of Uppy 1.0 on April 25**. Here's what we've been up to since
yesterday's progress update.

<!--truncate-->

- [Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju) addressed all of
  [Marius'](https://github.com/Acconut) feedback towards
  [having React-Native-compatible fingerprinting](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/pull/73)
  in tus-js-client.

- [Artur](https://github.com/arturi) and [Alex](https://github.com/nqst) had a
  call where they discussed Alex’s design improvements, and Alex's
  [Design Facelift PR](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1442) is now
  ready to be reviewed and merged :tada:

- Artur iterated on [Samuel's](https://github.com/samuelayo)
  [XHR backend examples](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1389).

- Ife, Artur, Alex and Marius are chasing down an issue where appending form
  fields is
  [causing 423 responses from tusd](https://github.com/tus/tusd/issues/259).
  Marius already pushed out a number of fixes as a result and released a new
  version of tus-js-client (1.7.1).

- Artur and [Kevin](https://github.com/tim-kos) paired up to create a new
  structure for [Locale Packs](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1443).
  The `en_US` locale is now generated from whatever strings where used in Uppy's
  plugins, so other languages can use it as a reference. There will also be
  reporting on unused strings.

- [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) continues to charge at fixing Drag &
  Drop issues, and [Renée](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop) is working on
  making the Robodog Dashboard work inline (as well as a popup).

Hope you'll have a great weekend and see you on
[Monday](/blog/2019/04/liftoff-21/) for another real update on the 1.0 launch
preparations! We'll of course also have a few more light-hearted posts in the
meantime for you, so be sure to check those out as well :slightly_smiling_face:
