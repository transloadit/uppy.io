Two weeks left in our '30 Days to Liftoff'! We're starting to home in on **Uppy
1.0's release on April 25**. Being in the middle of the week gives us a great
opportunity to see how hard the team is working. Let's take a look at the new
features, bug fixes and milestones that have been completed! :dog:

Reminder: you can keep up with our
[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) to see
everything else we intend to complete for the official Uppy 1.0 release.

## Done

- [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) continues working on the
  [peculiar flickering issue](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1400#issuecomment-481039845)
  in our Dashboard example. While it was tricky at first, a (temporary) hotfix
  has now been applied. A more in-depth update is coming after 1.0 :smile:

- The [first contribution](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1436) in our
  sprint coming from outside the Uppy team was added by
  [Zeqiu](https://github.com/allenfantasy). It concerns events being fired when
  an uploaded file fails a restriction check. With this feature, it will be a
  lot easier to know which file has been restricted from upload and why.

- And the
  [second outside contribution](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1429)
  comes from [Andreas](https://github.com/ap--), who fixed an issue involving
  the use of both tus and the limit parameter to set a maximum number of
  parallel uploads.

Big shout out to both!

## In Progress

- The React Native team has their pairing session at 14:00 today, during which
  they will work on
  [React Native support](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/988) for Uppy,
  [tus-js-client](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client) and
  [Companion](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/tree/master/packages/@uppy/companion).

  - [Artur](https://github.com/arturi) will be working on tweaking the React
    Native UI and dealing with file preview icons for non-image files. He has
    also been working on refactoring some of the code to make things much
    tidier.
  - [Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju) will be integrating
    fingerprinting and hash code support
    [into tus-js-client](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/pull/73).
  - If the team has the time, they will also look into large file support,
    upload and download reporting for Companion XHR uploads, and an issue
    concerning XHR uploads with the
    [Transloadit API](https://transloadit.com/docs/api/).

- [Alex](https://github.com/nqst) continues improving Uppy's UI and has recently
  been refactoring CSS code, while Evgenia keeps charging at the
  [many accessibility issues](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/created_by/nqst)
  that are still open.

In addition to getting Uppy 1.0 out of the dog house, I mentioned that the team
is already talking about features and fixes to tackle after 1.0. If you look at
our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md),
you'll notice some 1.1 todos in there. There's always room for improvement, so
now you have something to look forward to after Uppy 1.0 hits the web! :wink:

That's all from me today. Stay in the loop with us on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/uppy_io) or [RSS](https://uppy.io/blog/atom.xml)
for more Uppy updates. [Day 17](/blog/2019/04/liftoff-17/) is coming up next!
