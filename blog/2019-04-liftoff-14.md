Today marks the fourteenth day in our '30 Days to Liftoff' blog post challenge,
working our way towards **launching Uppy 1.0 on April 25**. It's the beginning
of a new week and there is much to be done. The Uppy team is already firing on
all cylinders and we also have some developments to share from before the
weekend.

Let's jump right in!

## Done

- [Ren√©e](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop) finished work on
  [canceling Transloadit Assemblies](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1431)
  when you abort uploads.

- [Artur](https://github.com/arturi) published the
  [CHANGELOG for 0.30.4](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/commit/845369f0e56b49ab51d4d01909dfdac6f60b1748),
  which was a bit more work to figure out now that the whole Transloadit team is
  piling commits onto `master` :scream: We also completed a few smaller tasks,
  such as fixing an issue with our build scripts and updating the Companion
  docs.

## Done for React Native

This is a pretty big one! [Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju) and Artur
delivered on the bare essentials for React Native. In our local tests, this
means we can now successfully pick different files, have their uploads resume
where they left off, select a remote file via Companion (for now, only picking
from URL is supported) and see the progress reported by it.

There is a basic UI, most of which is encapsulated in the example that we'll
publish on our website. We're refraining from building too much UI in our React
Native module, as we assume that developers will want to have full control and
style everything close to their app. We figured they would care most about
seeing a good example and having access to core functionality, such as making
mobile uploads more reliable and less draining on batteries and data plans.

While there are still things to be implemented, such as picking files from
Instagram, we now know that we have all the Lego bricks required and that they
are doing what they're supposed to. Now, it's just a matter of fleshing out
those integrations, but we'll have to see whether we can get to that before 1.0.
We're already happy about having a fixed idea about the API and a basic working
example as our deliverables!

## In Progress

- [Alex](https://github.com/nqst) is working on improving the Uppy design (in
  the code) in his `design-facelift` branch

- [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) is working on improving accessibility
  together with Alex, who found many issues that we still need to fix in this
  area.

- Now that the bare essentials of React Native work, Ife is making sure our
  local work finds a proper place in the tus-js-client (such as
  React-Native-compatible fingerprinting) while Artur hopes to find the time to
  tick off a few design goals to make for a better experience testdriving our
  example. Things like icons for files that are not images and a _Close_ button
  for the select file screen.

- The whole team will again do a call this afternoon to reassess our roadmap and
  see where all we stand. Some new tasks were added on
  [Friday](/blog/2019/04/liftoff-11/), so we'll also have to see about getting
  those into gear.

That's it for Day 14. Tomorrow, it will be Samuel's turn again to update you on
our board and progress. Subscribe via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/uppy_io) or
