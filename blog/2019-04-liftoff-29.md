With Easter behind us, only two days remain before the **Uppy 1.0 release!**. We
hope you're anticipating the launch as much as we are looking forward to being
out from under the pressure of geting everything done in time!

In terms of progress and completed features, things are looking good. We don't
have the entire team present today due to personal holidays and other
commitments, but there's no slowing down as we approach our deadline! This
afternoon, we're having our final Uppy 1.0 call where we'll make final decisions
on what we will — and won't — get done before Thursday.

- The [Russian language pack](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1467) for
  Uppy was added by [Artur](https://github.com/arturi).
  [Alex](https://github.com/nqst) and Evgenia have been weighing in with some
  feedback of their own to help get it completed. Feel free to contibute if you
  know Russian!

- The [Dutch languge pack](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1462) for
  Uppy was also added, this time not by one of us, but by an enterprising member
  of the Uppy community! Duizend maal dank,
  [Geert](https://github.com/geertclerx)!

- [Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju) fixed an issue involving the
  Transloadit API responding successfully before the upload is complete. This
  occurred when using XHR for uploading. Now, when using Companion, there will
  be a check for any mismatch in bytes from an uploaded file to ensure this does
  not happen any more.

- Ife's [fix](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1454) for issues with
  illusive progress for multipart uploads, was also tested and approved by
  Artur.

- [Artur's](https://github.com/arturi) contributions didn't end there! He also
  updated our
  [React Native example](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1469) to use
  Uppy 0.30.5.

- We had a bit of an issue after releasing Uppy 0.30.5, which involved
  [404 errors being thrown](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/1466) for
  certain 0.30.5-specific CSS and JS files. This was an issue regarding one of
  our CDN scripts, which was aptly fixed by [Kevin](https://github.com/kvz).

- [Abdel](https://github.com/kiloreux) is creating the French language pack for
  Uppy, and is considering working on an Arabic one for post-1.0 updates as
  well.

- [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) has continued her work on
  [accessibility issues with Uppy's provider views](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/created_by/nqst)
  and is planning on adding her improvements in the coming days.

Don't forget that today is Day 29 of our '30 Days to Liftoff' challenge. With
**Uppy 1.0** on its way and our blog post challenge coming to an end, we hope
you won't miss these quick updates too much! If you can't stand to miss our
grand finale [tomorrow](/blog/2019/04/liftoff-30/), make sure to follow us on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/uppy_io) and have a look at our
