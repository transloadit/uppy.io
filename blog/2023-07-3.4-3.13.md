This is a big Uppy update post, covering releases from
[`3.3.0` to `3.13.0`](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/compare/uppy%403.4.0...uppy%403.13.0)!

In this issue: the long-awaited unified S3 plugin which can switch between
regular and multipart uploads, improved performance when adding and validating
10k+ files, and stability improvements and bug fixes. The Transloadit plugin is
now also easier to configure and leaner in bundle size, since we removed
`socket.io-client` in favor of
[Server-Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events).

Please make a cup of something tasty ‚òïÔ∏è (in a non-spillable container), as this
will be quite a ride.

## AWS S3

### Merging of the plugins

After years of separating regular non-multipart uploads and multipart uploads,
we are finally merging the two sibling plugins: `@uppy/aws-s3` and
`@uppy/aws-s3-multpart`. Here‚Äôs the brief version of what you need to know, with
details to follow in the next section:

- `@uppy/aws-s3-multipart` is deprecated. You should use `@uppy/aws-s3` and set
  the `shouldUseMultipart: true` option to get the same ‚Äúmultipart always
  enabled‚Äù behavior. We plan to keep `@uppy/aws-s3-multipart` around as an alias
  for the next major cycle and add a warning at the install when Uppy 4.0.0 will
  be released.
- `@uppy/aws-s3` now hosts two plugins:
  - the legacy one, untouched, to guarantee backward compatibility. We plan to
    get rid of it in the next major, we recommend moving away from it and report
    if you see something missing in the new plugin.
  - the new merged plugin, available if you pass
    [`shouldUseMultipart`](https://uppy.io/docs/aws-s3-multipart/#shouldusemultipartfile)
    option.

Our plan for this merge is to maintain the backward compatibility until the next
major, while also providing forward compatibility so you can try our new plugin
and give us some feedback before we remove the old code for good.

### Conditional Multipart Explained

Multipart and ‚Äúregular‚Äù uploads have different use cases. The advantages of
multipart uploads are:

- **Improved throughput** ‚Äì You can upload parts in parallel to improve
  throughput.
- **Quick recovery from any network issues** ‚Äì Smaller part size minimizes the
  impact of restarting a failed upload due to a network error.
- **Pause and resume object uploads** ‚Äì You can upload object parts over time.
  After you initiate a multipart upload, there is no expiry; you must explicitly
  complete or stop the multipart upload.
- **Begin an upload before you know the final object size** ‚Äì You can upload an
  object as you are creating it.

However, the downside is _request overhead_, as it needs to do creation,
signing, and completion requests besides the upload requests. For example, if
you are uploading files that are only a couple kilobytes with a 100ms roundtrip
latency, you are spending 400ms on overhead and only a few milliseconds on
uploading. This really adds up if you upload a lot of small files.

So now you can use just one plugin, the `@uppy/aws-s3`, and enable multipart
conditionally, even per-file:

```js
uppy.use(AwsS3, {
	shouldUseMultipart(file) {
		// Use multipart only for files larger than 100MiB.
		return file.size > 100 * 2 ** 20;
	},
});
```

or

```js
uppy.use(AwsS3, {
	shouldUseMultipart: true,
});
```

Please see the new
[`shouldUseMultipart: boolean | function`](https://uppy.io/docs/aws-s3-multipart/#shouldusemultipartfile)
option for details.

### Signing on the client

By default, when you upload to S3 with Uppy, every file, or every chunk in case
of Multipart, needs to be signed on the server. For many small files or files
with many chunks this means a few additional requests per file/chunk of the
upload.

To address this issue and speed up the uploads by roughly 20%, we are
introducing a new option: `getTemporarySecurityCredentials: boolean | function`.
When `true`, both S3 and S3 Multipart uploads will be signed on the client using
the
[AWS Security Federation Token](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_GetFederationToken.html),
created once per user (until it expires) on your backend rather than a unique
signed URL for every single chunk.

:::caution

You should opt-in into this only if you are comfortable giving end users direct
access to signing files for your bucket.

### Stability and bug fixes

- We‚Äôve improved the internal handling of `RateLimitedQueue` to make
  [retries more robust](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/4424) and
  increased
  [priority of `abort` and `complete`](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/4542)
  requests.
- While we were at it, we‚Äôve also fixed
  [resuming in single-chunk uploads](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/4528),
  and improved
  [chunk size calculation](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/4508).
- [Golden Retriever integration with S3 Multipart](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/4526)
  was fixed.

Additionally, we‚Äôve disabled pause-resume buttons in the UI for remote S3
Multipart uploads ‚Äî¬†they are not supported on Companion, so the UI now reflects
that.

## Core

Performance of adding and uploading big batches of files has (yet again) been
greatly improved with refactors in both Uppy Core and Provider Views (that‚Äôs
what we internally call all remote UIs: Instagram, Unsplash, Dropbox).

We‚Äôve been able to achieve this by
[refactoring out totals validation for Restrictions (maxTotalFileSize, maxNumberOfFiles)](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/4402):
instead of doing it for each file, we perform the check at the end, after all
the files have been added/validated. This was confirmed to work with 10k+ files!
üöÄ

<img src="/img/blog/3.4-3.13/10k-files.jpg" className="border" alt="Uppy UI with over 10k files selected from a remote source" />

We‚Äôve also fixed an issue with delayed throttled progress events, which could
lead to incorrect progress.

## Transloadit

### assemblyOptions

We‚Äôve introduced a new option called
[`assemblyOptions: object | function`](https://uppy.io/docs/transloadit/#assemblyoptions),
which replaces the `getAssemblyOptions`, `params` and `fields` (those are now
deprecated and will be removed in the next major).

Here‚Äôs how you can use the new option as an object:

```js
uppy.use(Transloadit, {
	assemblyOptions: {
		params: {
			auth: { key: 'key-from-transloadit' },
			template_id: 'id-from-transloadit',
			steps: {
				// Overruling Template at runtime
			},
		},
		signature: 'generated-signature',
		fields: {
			// Dynamic or static fields to send along
		},
	},
});
```

And here‚Äôs an example with a function, to be able to set meta fields per-file,
for instance:

```js
uppy.use(Transloadit, {
	assemblyOptions(file) {
		return {
			params: {
				auth: { key: 'TRANSLOADIT_AUTH_KEY_HERE' },
				template_id: 'xyz',
			},
			fields: {
				caption: file.meta.caption,
			},
		};
	},
});
```

### Server-sent events

Historically Transloadit supported progress updates via Socket.io. It is a
robust and stable package, but came with a ‚Äúprice-tag‚Äù in the form of bundle
size:
[38.3 kB Minified](https://bundlephobia.com/package/socket.io-client@4.7.1). So
it‚Äôs been on our minds for a while to replace it with something more
lightweight, without breaking backwards-compatibility for the older clients (so
simply removing Socket.io on the server in favor of plain WebSockets is not
desireable).

The answer ‚Äî
[Server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events).
It‚Äôs a simple low-overhead one-way connection from Transloadit servers to
`@uppy/transloadit`. As was the case with Socket.io, we fall back to HTTP
polling every 2 seconds if SSE connection fails for some reason.

Socket.io is still around in `@uppy/transloadit`, but will be removed soon, once
SSE proves itself in production.

### Bug fixes

- Reset `tus` key in the file on error, so retried files are re-uploaded.
- Clean up event listener to prevent cancelled assemblies.
- Make sure `fields` is not nullish when there are no files in Assembly.

## Companion

### Refresh tokens

We‚Äôve
[implemented refresh tokens](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/4448) for
Dropbox and Google Drive to solve issued where tokens would expire in the middle
of a long upload and then the upload would fail.

Here‚Äôs how it‚Äôs implemented in Companion:

- We changed the logic when receiving a 401 from Companion, Uppy will now call a
  new `/:provider/refresh-token` endpoint which will give uppy a new access
  token.
- `refresh_token` is now stored inside uppy auth token along with `access_token`
  (encrypted JWT) for providers that give a refresh token (before only
  `access_token` was stored, now we store both as a `JSON.stringify`‚Äôd
  document).

### Bug fixes and improvements

- Fixed a bug with non-ASCII metadata crashed Companion. The AWS SDK doesn‚Äôt
  encode metadata by itself, so now we do it in Companion.
- Switched from aws-sdk v2 to @aws-sdk/\* v3
- Upgraded Grant dependency
- We now send expire info for non-multipart uploads and added connection
  keep-alive to Dropbox to improve connection stability
- Merged Provider and SearchProvider internal remote source classes.
- Increased max limits for remote file list operations and fixed part listing in
  S3

## Url

We‚Äôve upgraded the Url plugin to use `filename` from `Content-Disposition`
header of the file you are importing, instead of relying on the url (but kept
the latter as a fallback) (#4489). So now your files have proper names instead
of `noname`.

## Dashboard and Status Bar

Single File Mode has been improved to adapt to height of less than 400px ‚Äî the
UI turns back to grid in this case. We are also not using `fit: cover` anymore
to avoid cropping important parts of the image:

<img src="/img/blog/3.4-3.13/single-file-mode.jpg" className="border" alt="Uppy UI with single file" />

We‚Äôve also added an option to disable the Single File mode, as it can be
unwanted in certain use cases:
[`singleFileFullScreen`](https://uppy.io/docs/dashboard/#singlefilefullscreen).

If you wrapped Uppy Dashboard in a `<form>` element, it could be accidentally
submitted when a user pressed Enter to save meta fields or entering urls. Now
we‚Äôve
[added a `form=""` attribute, connected to an empty `<form>`](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/4283)
in document root to prevent the outer form from being submitted.

A bug has been fixed that allowed clicking on buttons and links in Dashboard
[disabled mode](https://uppy.io/docs/dashboard/#disabled).

Range selection of remote files has been fixed, you can now shift+click to
select multiple files again. We‚Äôve added the `VirtualList` component which is
already used in Uppy ‚Äúselected files‚Äù screen to remote file lists. So now
scrolling through 10k+ files is breeze üå¨Ô∏è

<img src="/img/blog/3.4-3.13/range-selection.jpg" className="border" alt="Dashboard UI with range selection" />

### Status Bar

- Fixed ETA when Uppy recovers its state.
- Remove throttled component to fix a bug where state would become shared
  between multiple status bars on a page.

## Locales

We‚Äôve added support for Hindi and Mexican Spanish. French, Spanish and Chinese
locales have been improved.

## Uploaders

- Fixed an issue where sockets were opened right away, ignoring the
  `RateLimitedQueue`, which led to bugs in all plugins that handle remote
  uploads. Additionally, when file is removed (or all are canceled), we call
  `controller.abort` on queued requests.
- Fixed a bug with sockets being closed, while the upload was still in progress.
- In XHR Upload we‚Äôve added support for arrays in metadata and an
  `'upload-stalled'` event.

## Miscellaneous

- `@uppy/golden-retriever` has been refactored refactor to modernize the
  codebase.
- We‚Äôve switched more non-critical errors to warnings.
- Improved fallbacks for the drag & drop API.
- The React Native example has been modernized and updated.
- `uppy.resetProgress()` in Core has been fixed.

We hope you‚Äôve enjoyed this update posts and all the fixes and features we‚Äôve
worked on! As always, please see the full changelog on GitHub:
