Hi all! We are back from holidays with a shiny new `0.23.0` release for you!
It‚Äôs packed with a new `Url` plugin (imports files from urls), refactored
`ThumbnailGenerator`, `Webcam` improvements and more.

## Import from Url

Meet our new ‚ÄúProvider‚Äù plugin, `Url`. It‚Äôs simple, yet powerful: paste a link
to any file on the web, and Uppy with Uppy Server will upload it wherever you
need.

```js
uppy.use(Url, { target: Dashboard, host: YOUR_UPPY_SERVER_URL });
```

## ThumbnailGenerator

Thumbnail generation has been refactored to a separate `ThumbnailGenerator`
plugin, thanks to the PR from
[@richardwillars](https://github.com/richardwillars). So Uppy Core is now more
lightweight, if you don‚Äôt need previews.

`ThumbnailGenerator` is still bundled with our most feature complete `Dashboard`
plugin though, so you don‚Äôt have to change anything if you were using that.

We‚Äôve also fixed previews in Safari and tweaked the code slightly after reading
the excellent
[Image resize in browsers is broken](https://blog.uploadcare.com/image-resize-in-browsers-is-broken-e38eed08df01)
post by Uploadcare üëå.

## Processing results

Processing results from encoding plugins like
[`Transloadit`](https://uppy.io/docs/transloadit/), are now added to `complete`
event:

```js
uppy.on('complete', (result) => {
	console.log(result);
	// result: {
	//   failed: [...],
	//   successful: [...],
	//   transloadit: [...],
	//   uploadID: "cjdnzj2zy0000c___iewu9m5y"
	// }
});
```

And to `uppy.upload()` promise result too:

```js
uppy.upload().then((result) => {
	console.log(result);
});
```

You can still use events like
[`transloadit:result`](https://uppy.io/docs/transloadit/#transloadit-result),
its just easier when things are in the same place. Plugins can use the new
`uppy.addResultData()` API to add data to the `result`, like so:

```js
uppy.addResultData(uploadID, { transloadit: assemblies });
```

## Webcam

The Webcam plugin now mirrors image previews by default, so when you are making
a selfie and wave with your right hand, you see that right hand in the Webcam
preview, just like in the mirror. This option can be disabled via
`uppy.use(Webcam, { mirror: false }`. Note that the resulting image will not be
mirrored, so your hand will actually be waving on the left. This mimics the
behaviour of smarphone selfie cameras.

We‚Äôve also added an option to select which camera will be used to capture
pictures or video:
[facingMode](https://uppy.io/docs/webcam/#facingMode-39-user-39), set to `user`
(front camera) by default.

## Server

- You can now specify a config path when starting the standalone Uppy Server
  like so `uppy-server --config /path/to/uppyconf.json`. The config file is
  expected to be a JSON file with the same schema as the Uppy Server options.
- A periodic cleanup job has been added to Uppy Server, to delete stale upload
  files from the specified `filePath`. Even though we'd rarely expect uploaded
  files to go undeleted immediately, there could be cases where an error occurs
  during an upload, and so Uppy Server leaves the file undeleted to give room
  for upload retries. With the cleanup job in place, we can ensure that this
  file would eventually be deleted after the file upload is done.
- Responses from Multipart uploads are now relayed to Uppy Client as they are
  received from the target server. With this in place, you can now handle
  responses from local and remote XHRUpload in nearly the same way.

## Other Improvements and Additions

- Added new option to hide ProgressBar and StatusBar after upload finish (#485 /
  @wilkoklak)
- Chaining API has been improved, you can now use `.on` and `.off` anywhere:
  `uppy.use(Dashboard).use(Tus).on('complete', handleComplete).run()`
- The Transloadit plugin now has a new `transloadit:assembly-executing` event
  and passes Assembly results to the `complete` callback (#547, #527 /
  @goto-bus-stop)
- We‚Äôve added a `bundle` option to the `XHRUpload` plugin to send multiple files
  in one request (#442 / @goto-bus-stop)
- Uppy releases are now hosted on Edgly CDN by Transloadit
- A Third-party extension for integrating the Ngrx Angular state management
  library with Uppy has been released,
  [uppy-store-ngrx](https://github.com/rimlin/uppy-store-ngrx/) by @rimlin

## Other Fixes

- Fixed blank preview thumbnails for images in Safari; use slightly different
  step scaling (#458, #584 / @arturi)
- We now log in console and show an Informer message, not error in console, when
  file cannot be added due to restrictions (#604, #492 / @goto-bus-stop).
- Unused files have been removed from published package, saving many many
  precious megabytes :) (#586 / @goto-bus-stop)
- Use empty input value so same file can be selected multiple times (@arturi /
  #534)
- Fix modal and page scroll (#564 / @arturi)
- Refactor provider views (#554 / @arturi)
- Lots of documentation fixes, thanks to all our contributors!

## Press

Uppy has made some appearances on the internet recently.

1\.
**[Better File Uploads with Shrine: Direct Uploads](https://janko.io/better-file-uploads-with-shrine-direct-uploads/)**:

On how to set up Uppy with [Shrine](http://shrinerb.com/), a file attachment
toolkit for Ruby applications. It starts off with an example of a plain `<form>`
upload and builds up to a more advanced experience:

> - When the user submits the form with selected files, there is no indicator
>   telling them when the upload will finish.
> - When the user is uploading multiple files at once and the request happens to
>   get aborted, it‚Äôs not possible to keep the files that were uploaded so far,
>   because all files are sent in a single request. In other words, multiple
>   uploads are all-or-nothing.
> - Files are validated only after they have been uploaded, which means the user
>   needs to wait until the upload finishes before they can know whether their
>   file was even valid.
>
> We can improve that by asynchronously starting to upload files on the client
> side as soon as they‚Äôre selected. This also gives users the ability to
> continue filling in other fields while files are being uploaded, because the
> UI isn‚Äôt blocked during the upload.
>
> There are many popular JavaScript file upload libraries out there ‚Äì
> jQuery-File-Upload, Dropzone.js, FineUploader etc. ‚Äì but the one you should
> use with Shrine is definitely Uppy üê∂. Uppy is a modular library that knows
> how to upload files to a custom endpoint on your app, to Amazon S3, or even to
> a resumable endpoint, providing progress bars, drag & drop functionality,
> image previews, file validations etc, all while making as few assumptions as
> possible.
