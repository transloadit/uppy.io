Only six days remain in our '30 Days to Liftoff' blog post challenge toward
**releasing Uppy 1.0 on April 25**. Technically, it's even less than that,
seeing as Easter is coming up and we won't be doing much work during the
holidays. So, with just three working days left, we are starting to feel the
heat. :fire:

Luckily, we're also very close to reaching all of our release goals. Let's take
a look at where we are now!

- [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) has made some great progress on
  improving the
  [drag to upload state](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1440) for the
  Uppy Dashboard in a variety of browsers. We are also considering adding more
  MIME types later, to report types correctly even when browser fail at it and
  give file previews their own unique icons.

- [Alex's](https://github.com/nqst)
  [design facelift](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1452) was completed
  after some testing by [Artur](https://github.com/arturi). Take a look at some
  of the improvements below:

- [Tim](https://github.com/tim-kos) will be spending today thoroughly testing
  Uppy in preparation for the upcoming release. We think just about everything
  is working, so now it's time for someone to try and break it all! :hammer:
  Slight warning: we're in the process of making some big behind-the-scenes
  changes, so there may be some issues that crop up on our webpage.

- Uppy 0.30.5 will be released by [Artur](https://github.com/arturi) today. One
  of the main changes here is our name change from the `serverUrl` property to
  `companionUrl`. A simple check is being added and we will notify users that it
  has been depreceated, so they have ample time to apply the change to their own
  code.

- An alpha version of
  [React Native support](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/988) was
  merged into our Uppy master branch on Github. We're confident that our initial
  release will be useful for those who need a basic implementation. Of course,
  our React Native development will continue as we go forth, so stay tuned for
  that.

- [Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju) and
  [Marius](https://github.com/Acconut) continue their work on large-file issues
  related to React Native and tus-js-client. They are considering to add a tus
  option to allow React Native developers to pass their own custom file picker
  module. This would add some flexibility for developers and prevent us from
  bloating tus-js-client.

- Error reporting for the Transloadit plugin will be worked on by
  [Ren√©e](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop). This will ensure users are notified
  of various issues while utilizing the API, such as connection issues.

Thus ends Day 24. We're all taking an early break for Good Friday tomorrow and
we hope you'll have a Good one as well! Check us out on
