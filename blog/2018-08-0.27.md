In `0.27`, we have some more iterations on the Dashboard UI for you in store
again. We are getting rid of the permanent tab bar and made tons of other
improvements!

<!--truncate-->

## Dashboard UI without tabs

Uppy used to always display the tab bar (the one you use to select between
importing files from Instagram, Webcam, local disk, etc.). This ended up not
working well with the growing list of supported sources, especially on mobile.

<img src="/img/blog/0.27/uppy-with-tabs.jpg" />

So in `0.27`, we are iterating on the UI again:

<img src="/img/blog/0.27/uppy-add-initial.jpg" />

The providers are now visible as a list of icons on the initial screen (plus,
we’ve added colors!), but when you complete the inital selection, it is hidden
behind the “plus” button:

<img src="/img/blog/0.27/uppy-files-selected.jpg" />

You can always add more:

<img src="/img/blog/0.27/uppy-add-more.jpg" />

The StatusBar that shows progress has been “lightened”:

<img src="/img/blog/0.27/uppy-upload-in-progress.jpg" />

<img src="/img/blog/0.27/uppy-upload-complete.jpg" />

We have decided to drop multiple-color support, so Informer messages will now
always appear in a gray, round bubble. Apart from that, we have made tons of
small fixes, such as better animations, colors, font sizes, and more.
[Check out the PR #942](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/942) for
details.

We are aiming to make the UI less heavy, so that Uppy can easier fit within your
existing site or app design.

The mobile version is now much more refined as well:

## `autoProceed: false` by default

⚠️ **breaking**

By default, Uppy used to begin uploading right after you selected a file. If you
wanted to let users edit some file metadata or pick and choose from multiple
sources first, you had to set `autoProceed: false`:

```js
// this line could be seen in many of the Uppy examples
const uppy = Uppy({ autoProceed: false });
```

Since in most cases we actually wanted `autoProceed: false`, this is now the new
default. While it makes Uppy's UI less magical and harder to make irreversible
mistakes with, right out of the box, we feel this is the way to go. Make sure
you change this in your project if needed. If you weren't setting an
`autoProceed` option at all, you will now have to add `autoProceed: true`.

## Progress on React Native

We’ve begun working on supporting React Native in Uppy. Since `0.27`, it should
run in a React Native environment — meaning you can use Uppy API
(`uppy.addFile()`, `uppy.upload()`) for adding files and uploading, without the
UI. `@uppy/xhr-upload` uploader is already supported, and we are working on
making `@uppy/tus` (and `tus-js-client` itself) run in React Native as well.

We plan to make sure all non-UI Uppy plugins work in RN, and then provide a few
useful components for adding Uppy to your RN apps.

Please head to the
[React Native PR #988](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/988) for
details. We'd love to hear what you think and your suggestions for improving the
Uppy React Native experience.

Built-in React Native support has been a 1.0 goal from the start. We have had
many requests about Angular.js and Vue support. There are already
community-built solutions for these platforms that seem to work well, but
unfortunately we won't be officially supporting them before our 1.0 milestone.
Depending on community input, we might add that later.

## Package sizes

We now have a cool table showing mingzipped bundle sizes for each individual
Uppy package:

<img width="400" src="/img/blog/0.27/uppy-sizes.png" />

## "Uppy Server" is now "Companion"

```bash
npm install @uppy/companion
```

Uppy Server is an optional service that Uppy can use to import files from
sources like Instagram or Dropbox. However, simply naming it "Server" was quite
unclear and has caused some confusion. Many people thought you could upload
files to Uppy Server as well, but that is not the case. We recommend uploading
to a [tus.io](https://tus.io) server, or — if that's too much for your simple
usecase — using your existing webserver to handle the upload.

So, to hopefully end this confusion once and for all, we are renaming Uppy
Server to Companion: an optional tool in the datacenter, which you can use to
add more functionality to your Uppy.js client. If nothing else, maybe it will
net us some points for having yet another dog-themed name!

Simultaneously, we moved Companion into the main
[transloadit/uppy](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy)
[monorepo](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md).
This centralizes Uppy issue reporting and makes it easier to do updates and
simultaneous releases of the client and Companion parts.

The first release of `@uppy/companion` is 0.14, and the last `uppy-server`
release is 0.13.4. `uppy-server` will be deprecated on npm soon.

Note that despite the rename, configuration for standalone Companion still uses
`UPPYSERVER_` environment variables. This should ease the transition, since you
will only have to update the package name for now. Once we add `COMPANION_`
variable support, we will continue to support `UPPYSERVER_` environment
variables to smoothen the transition. And of course, we will notify you here
when that time comes!

## Other Cool Changes
