Hey guys! How is your Saturday treating you so far? We are focusing today on
meeting friends and having fun, and taking our minds off all Uppy-related things
for just a few days. To give you an idea of what we're up to tonight, check out

We won't have much in terms of real news to share over the weekend, but we'll be
back in full force on [Monday](/blog/2019/04/liftoff-14/)! In the meantime, we
hope you have a great day! And see you tomorrow for another weekend update in
our 30 Days to Liftoff!
