For the past six months, we have been working hard on uppy.io. We feel that it
is high time we gave you a look behind the scenes: what are we working on, and
why.

The way uploading works has not changed in a meaningful way since the days of
our trusty old 56 kbit/s modems. Of course, files have gotten bigger and speeds
have increased, but that is more or less all there is to say. If it were up to
us – and we hope it is – that is all about to change.

We at [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com/) are on a mission to change the way
the world does uploading. To accomplish this, our first step has been to develop
an open protocol for resumable file uploads, called [‘tus’](http://tus.io/).
Finally, that 2GB video upload from your smartphone doesn’t have to start over
when your train passes through a tunnel! The protocol got
[Hacker News excited](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10591348) on several
occasions and is being deployed by, among others, our friends at Vimeo. Now that
a stable version 1.0 of ‘tus’ has been released, it is time to put it to the
test. A protocol without real-world applications is nothing more than a
meaningless document, after all.

We are therefore excited to tell you about Uppy: the file uploader that will
certainly fetch more than just your newspaper.

## Why the need for another file uploader?

It is true, there are indeed already a good few file uploading solutions out
there ([Dropzone](http://www.dropzonejs.com/), for instance, is quite good). And
– for the most part – they do their job. Nevertheless, they are quite limited in
their functionality:

- You can drag and drop files from local disk, but uploaders that supports
  Instagram, Dropbox or Google Drive are scarce. The ones out there lock you in
  with vendors and are hard to customize for own use.

- File uploaders are seldom mindful of the existence of encoding and processing
  backends, while the reality is that files often require some form of
  processing and that the end user would like to receive progress updates with
  regard to that.

- None of the currently available file uploaders make use of the standardized
  resumability that ‘tus’ provides, which makes them less than ideal for
  handling larger files.

- Lastly, we feel that the current solutions are sometimes dropping the ball
  when it comes to a polished user experience. We aim to fix that.

All in all, we think there is definitely some ‘trouble at the old mill’ here and
it’s time to let Uppy take care of that!

## Our plans for Uppy

Uppy will be a JavaScript file uploader that allows you to fetch files, not only
from your local disk, but also from places like Dropbox, Instagram, Google
Drive, webcams and remote URLs. It will have a modular, plugin-based design,
making it lightweight and customizable.

Cute on the outside, the core of Uppy is very robust – thanks to resumability
through 'tus'. We are confident that Uppy will be able to send even the biggest
of files over the smallest of tubes.

Uppy will also offer first class support for accessing Transloadit’s uploading
and encoding backend, making it incredibly versatile. Of course, these are all
ultimately just plugins, and Uppy can just as easily be used with your own
backend – meaning no need to pay any subscription fees.

We are intent on making the user experience as smooth and satisfying as
possible, in terms of both functionality and visual design. Uppy will have a
beautiful, themeable UI and it will look – and work – great on mobile platforms
as well. While we hope that advanced users will love the customizable nature of
Uppy, an ample selection of presets will also be there to make sure that novice
users are not going to be lost in the woods.

Lastly, and this is a point of special significance to us, Uppy will be
completely open source. When Uppy is finished, you will be free to use it for
whatever you like. Until that time, we very much welcome your ideas and
contributions. There are still a lot of decisions to be made and this is the
perfect time to come and influence the end product.

We are going to work hard on bringing you the best file uploader possible and
we’ll keep you informed about the development process on
[uppy.io](http://uppy.io/). We can’t wait for you to meet Uppy!
