And on the seventh day, Uppy rested :angel: We, too, will be spending this day
in quiet contemplation (and most certainly not by sleeping off yesterday's
escapades). So if there isn't anything else you need us for, we'll be grabbing
our blankets and heading back to bed:

Feel free to hit that snooze button a few more times yourself, before enjoying
the remainder of your weekend. We'll see you back tomorrow on
[Day 21](/blog/2019/04/liftoff-21/), when we'll have some more real news to
share as we head into the final stretch of our 30 Days to Liftoff!
