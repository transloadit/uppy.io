Uppy 1.26 brings a new `disabled` option for the Dashboad, ability to set
headers per file with XHR Upload, and fixes for the Transloadit plugin.

## Dashboard “Disabled”

You can now specify a `disabled` option for the Dashboard, in order to make it
non-interactive and grayed out. Users won’t be able to click on buttons or drop
files.

This is useful when you need to confitionally enable/disable file uploading or
manipulation, based on a condition in your app.

This option can be set on init:

```js
uppy.use(Dashboard, {
	disabled: true,
});
```

and via API:

```js
const dashboard = uppy.getPlugin('Dashboard');
dashboard.setOptions({ disabled: true });

userNameInput.addEventListener('change', () => {
	dashboard.setOptions({ disabled: false });
});
```

[See the docs](https://uppy.io/docs/dashboard/#disabled-false).

## XHR Upload Per File headers

`@uppy/xhr-upload` now accept a `headers: (file) => {}` function, so you can do:

```js
uppy.use(XHRUpload, {
	headers: (file) => ({
		authorization: `bearer ${global.userToken}`,
		'header-name': file.meta.someMetaValue,
	}),
});
```

to determine file-specific headers.

The function syntax for `headers` is only available if the `bundle` option is
`false` (the default). `bundle` uploads share only one set of headers.

## Build System Improvements

- build: set legacy-peer-deps for npm 7. We have some peerDependency mismatches
  in our install tree. In npm 6 this was OK (maybe reason for a warning) but in
  npm 7 they hard fail the install
- build: added npm version check (33e656cad32b865f960dbd88abf4d3839c8377f0 /
  @goto-bus-stop)

## Transloadit Plugin

- Fixed a case where the plugin used stale file data.
- Fixed polling fallback bugs.
- Url concatenation is now more robust.

## Misc

- @uppy/companion: Docker tag release (#2771 / @kiloreux)
- @uppy/companion: Companion should respect previously set value for
  Accesss-Control-Allow-Methods (#2726 / @tim-kos, @mifi, @so-steve)
- @uppy/transloadit: fix polling fallback bugs (#2759 / @goto-bus-stop)
- @uppy/utils: added mp4 file type support — Safari 14.0 on Mac records audio
  using audio/mp4 MIME type which isn't currently recognised by Uppy (#2753 /
  @dominiceden)
