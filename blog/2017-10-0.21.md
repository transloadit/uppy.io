Hi all! We’ve been busy with Halloween, but also another release, so here is
Uppy `0.21`! This one improves accessibility, features new end-to-end tests and
improved security in Uppy Server.

<!--truncate-->

## Accessibility

One of the goals we’ve set out to achieve with Uppy was to make an accessibe
file upload widget, and in this release we’ve achieved some more progress in
this area:

- Dashboard modal dialog now handles focus better (it’s trapped inside the modal
  while open);
- First button is in focus right after the modal dialog is open;
- More (aria-)labels have been added;
- Files from remote providers are now selectable with a keyboard.

We plan to continue gradually improving in the accessibility area.

See [#414 PR](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/414) for details.

## Returning `{ successful, failed }` from `uppy.upload()`

**⚠️ Breaking change**

`uppy.upload()` promise now resolves to a `result` object with two arrays of
files: `{ successful, failed }`. This lets you handle succesful and failed
uploads in one go:

```js
uppy.upload().then((result) => {
	console.info('Successful uploads:', result.successful);
	if (result.failed.length > 0) {
		console.error('Errors:');
		result.failed.forEach((file) => {
			console.error(file.error);
		});
	}
});

// or

uppy.on('core:complete', ({ successful, failed }) => {
	if (failed.length === 0) {
		console.log('UPLOAD SUCCESSFUL!!!');
	} else {
		console.warn('UPLOAD FAILED!!!');
	}
	console.log('successful files:', successful);
	console.log('failed files:', failed);
});
```

See [`uppy.upload()`](https://uppy.io/docs/uppy/#uppy-upload) and
[`core:complete`](https://uppy.io/docs/uppy/#core-complete) in docs, as well as
[#404 PR](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/404) for more details.

## End to end tests

We’ve refactored end to end tests to use [Webdriver.io](http://webdriver.io),
and for the occasion added tests for Edge, Safari, Android and iOS. Now tests on
Travis and Sauce Labs (thanks for the open source tier!) run smoothly and it’s
easier to alter them or write new ones.

## More secure Uppy Server

We made sure access tokens from third-party providers, such as Google Drive or
Instagram, are not stored on the server with Uppy Server, and kept in your
browser instead. Then, when you want to pick a file from your Instagram, the
token is used to make a request to Uppy Server, which is in turn used by Uppy
Server to communicate with Instagram.

Data validation is also now done during intiation of an upload, to prevent
corrupt data from triggering funny behaviours on the server. :)

And, while we were at this, we also made sure all sensitive data is masked in
request logs.

## Migration to Dropbox v2 API

Since the
[deprecation of Dropbox v1 API](https://blogs.dropbox.com/developers/2017/09/api-v1-shutdown-details/),
uppy/uppy-server have now been updated to use the v2 API. It is implemented to
work closely as its previous implementation so there should be no worries.

## Custom plugin id

Up until now you could only use a plugin once with an Uppy instance. Now you can
pass custom `id` for any plugin (though this has to be manually implemented in
any new plugin). This allows using, for example, two `StatusBar`s, one inside
the `Dashboard`, and one somewhere on the page, visible even when `Dashboard` is
closed.

Can be used like this:

```js
// one StatusBar comes included in the Dashboard, another will be mounted on the page
.use(Dashboard {...})
.use(StatusBar, { id: 'PageStatusBar', target: 'body' }
```

See [#418 PR](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/418) for details.

## Misc good stuff

- Migrated Dropbox in Uppy Server to use v2 API.
- Fixed generating thumbnails for images with transparent background.
- We are now using [`tinyify`](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop/tinyify)(by our
  own [@goto-bus-stop](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop)) for the Uppy bundle to
  make it smaller and more efficient.
- Instead of restarting only the file upload itself, start an entirely new
  upload for retries. Fixes retrying uploads with processing plugins.
- The S3 plugin now includes XHRUpload. **⚠️ Breaking change: you should remove
  `.use(XHRUpload)` when using S3.**
- XHRUpload now includes a timeout `opts.timeout = 30000`, after which it errors
  and offers a retry (retry UI supported in Dashboard), see
  [#378](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/378) for more.
- Renamed `RestoreFiles` → `GoldenRetriever`, and `Tus10` → `Tus`. **⚠️ Breaking
  change: please make sure to use the new names when setting up plugins**.
- The Webcam plugin has been refactored. There’s no flash fallback now, it works
  in modern browsers only, and the Webcam tab won’t appear in the Dashboard if a
  camera is not supported on the device.
