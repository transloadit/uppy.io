import HeadlessComponentsShared from '/docs/framework-integrations/_headless-components-shared.mdx';

Uppy 5.0 is here, and our faithful file-uploading companion has been busy
fetching the most requested feature of all time: truly composable, headless UI
components. For years, developers have found themselves stuck between
Dashboard's kitchen-sink approach and the bare-bones drag-drop plugin, with
little room to build something that fits just right.

This release brings headless components and hooks to address those needs.
Everything has been backported on 4.0 as well so you donâ€™t need to upgrade
to get going.

With Uppy 5.0's , you can finally build the exact upload
experience your users deserve â€“ modular, accessible, and tailored to your needs.
Whether you need a simple file picker or a complex multi-source interface,
Uppy's got the building blocks to make it happen.

## Headless components and hooks

### One size fits no one

Developers starting with Uppy are forced to choose between the full-featured,
bundle size heavy, and non-customizable `dashboard` or the overly barebones
`drag-drop`.

After years of speaking to developers on GitHub, the community forum, and with
Transloadit customers â€“ the reality seems to be that majority of people have
their needs fall somewhere in between `dashboard` and `drag-drop`. Countless
issues have been posted about them wanting mostly X but doing Y different for
their use case.

`@uppy/dashboard` has tried to accommodate for some of these requests over the
years which introduced overly specific "toggles", such as
`showLinkToFileUploadResult`, `showProgressDetails`, `hideUploadButton`,
`hideRetryButton`, `hidePauseResumeButton`, `hideCancelButton`,
`hideProgressAfterFinish`, `showRemoveButtonAfterComplete`, `disableStatusBar`,
`disableInformer`, and `disableThumbnailGenerator`.

Continuing down this path is not maintainable nor will we ever reach a set of
"toggles" at this granularity level to support a wide range of use cases and
unique requirements.

### Fake promise of modular UI components

We built `status-bar`, `progress-bar`, `image-editor`, `thumbnail-generator`,
`informer`, and `provider-views` as separate plugins, communicating on a first
glance these are standalone components, but they are tightly coupled to
`dashboard`. It's not impossible to use them separately, but there is little flexibility.

### Modern expectations

Since Uppy's conception 10 years ago the front-end landscape has significantly
changed. Uppy is even built with a "vanilla" first approach because that was
still popular at the time over front-end frameworks.

**These days developers have high expectations for choosing a library**. In a world
where everything is component driven, OSS UI libraries are expected to offer
truly composable building blocks, which are light on bundle size, and ideally
with accessibility kept in mind.

For Uppy to stay relevant in the coming years a major chance is needed in how we
let users built their uploading UI.

### New components and hooks

> TODO: pretty image showing all components

**Uppy 5.0 introduces composable, UI components and hooks that provide granular
control without sacrificing first-class framework support**. These components are designed to
be lightweight, accessible, and fully customizable while maintaining
compatibility with **React, Vue, and Svelte**.

Uppy now offers three ways to build user interfaces:

1. **Pre-composed, plug-and-play components.** Nothing new here, mainly `<Dashboard />` and
   `<DragDrop />`. The downside is that you canâ€™t customize the UI.
2. **Headless components ðŸ†•** Smaller componentes, easier to override the styles
   or compose them together with your own components.
3. **Hooks ðŸ†•** Attach our logic to your own components, no restrictions, create a
   tailor-made UI.
	
### New components

All components work within the `<UppyContextProvider />` and come with sensible
defaults but expose data attributes for complete styling control. This approach
delivers the flexibility developers need while maintaining the plug-and-play
experience Uppy is known for.

Let's explore these components through practical examples that build upon each
other.

### Example: dropzone, file list, status bar

The simplest upload interface combines three core components: a dropzone for
file selection, a file list to show selected files, and an upload button to
start the process.

```jsx
import Uppy from '@uppy/core';
import {
	Dropzone,
	FilesList,
	UploadButton,
	UppyContextProvider,
} from '@uppy/react';
import Tus from '@uppy/tus';
import { useState } from 'react';

function BasicUploadExample() {
	const [uppy] = useState(() =>
		new Uppy().use(Tus, {
			endpoint: 'https://tusd.tusdemo.net/files/',
		}),
	);

	return (
		<UppyContextProvider uppy={uppy}>
			<Dropzone />
			<FilesList />
			<UploadButton />
		</UppyContextProvider>
	);
}
```

This creates a functional upload interface with just three components. The
`<Dropzone />` handles file selection through drag-and-drop or clicking,
`<FilesList />` displays selected files with progress indicators, and
`<UploadButton />` initiates the upload process.

#### Styling Component States

Components expose their internal state through data attributes, enabling precise
CSS targeting. The `<UploadButton />` provides different states that you can
style individually:

```css
button[data-uppy-element='upload-button'][data-state='init'] {
	background-color: #3b82f6;
}

button[data-uppy-element='upload-button'][data-state='uploading'] {
	background-color: #f59e0b;
	cursor: wait;
}

button[data-uppy-element='upload-button'][data-state='complete'] {
	background-color: #10b981;
}

button[data-uppy-element='upload-button'][data-state='error'] {
	background-color: #ef4444;
}
```

The state-based styling system allows you to provide visual feedback that
matches your application's design system while maintaining the component's
accessibility and functionality.

#### Building Custom Interfaces with Hooks

For maximum flexibility, combine React hooks to create completely custom upload
interfaces. The `useDropzone()` and `useFileInput()` hooks provide the building
blocks for custom dropzones that fit your exact requirements:

```jsx
import { ProviderIcon, useDropzone, useFileInput } from '@uppy/react';

function CustomDropzone() {
	const { getRootProps, getInputProps } = useDropzone({ noClick: true });
	const { getButtonProps, getInputProps: getFileInputProps } = useFileInput();

	return (
		<div>
			<input {...getInputProps()} className="hidden" />
			<div
				{...getRootProps()}
				className="border-2 border-dashed border-gray-300 rounded-lg p-6 bg-gray-50"
			>
				<div className="flex items-center justify-center">
					<input {...getFileInputProps()} className="hidden" />
					<button
						{...getButtonProps()}
						className="hover:bg-gray-100 p-2 rounded-md flex flex-col items-center gap-2"
					>
						<div className="bg-white shadow-md rounded-md p-1">
							<ProviderIcon provider="device" fill="#1269cf" />
						</div>
						Select Files
					</button>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
	);
}
```

This custom dropzone focuses solely on device file selection, giving you
complete control over the layout and interactions while leveraging Uppy's proven
drag-and-drop handling.
