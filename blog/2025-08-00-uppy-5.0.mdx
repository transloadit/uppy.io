new things:
- Headless components and hooks, which are backwards compatible and released on 4.0 as well.
- Export maps for all packages, now optional peer dependencies are truly optional
- Revamped examples, including new ones such as Next.js, SvelteKit, React Router, and more.

## Headless components and hooks

### The problem

#### One size fits no one

Developers starting with Uppy are forced to choose between the full-featured,
bundle size heavy, and non-customizable `dashboard` or the overly barebones
`drag-drop`.

After years of speaking to developers on GitHub, the community forum, and with
Transloadit customers â€“ the reality seems to be that majority of people have
their needs fall somewhere in between `dashboard` and `drag-drop`. Countless
issues have been posted about them wanting mostly X but doing Y different for
their use case.

`@uppy/dashboard` has tried to accommodate for some of these requests over the
years which introduced overly specific "toggles", such as
`showLinkToFileUploadResult`, `showProgressDetails`, `hideUploadButton`,
`hideRetryButton`, `hidePauseResumeButton`, `hideCancelButton`,
`hideProgressAfterFinish`, `showRemoveButtonAfterComplete`, `disableStatusBar`,
`disableInformer`, and `disableThumbnailGenerator`.

Continuing down this path is not maintainable nor will we ever reach a set of
"toggles" at this granularity level to support a wide range of use cases and
unique requirements.

#### Fake promise of modular UI components

We built `status-bar`, `progress-bar`, `image-editor`, `thumbnail-generator`,
`informer`, and `provider-views` as separate plugins, communicating on a first
glance these are standalone components, but they are tightly coupled to
`dashboard`. It's not impossible to use them separately, but this is
discouraged, undocumented, and unclear which features won't work outside of
`dashboard`.

#### Modern expectations

Since Uppy's conception 10 years ago the front-end landscape has significantly
changed. Uppy is even built with a "vanilla" first approach because that was
still popular at the time over front-end frameworks.

These days developers have high expectations for choosing a library. In a world
where everything is component driven, OSS UI libraries are expected to offer
truly composable building blocks, which are light on bundle size, and ideally
with accessibility kept in mind.

For Uppy to stay relevant in the coming years a major chance is needed in how we
let users built their uploading UI.

### Solution

**Composable, headless Uppy UI components**. These would be highly granular and
without loosing support for our existing frameworks (Angular, Svelte, React,
Vue).


Note to claude: these are the available components, rewrite to succinct prose style overview instead of code.

export { default as Dropzone } from './Dropzone.js'
export { default as FilesGrid } from './FilesGrid.js'
export { default as FilesList } from './FilesList.js'
export { default as ProviderIcon } from './ProviderIcon.js'
export { default as Thumbnail } from './Thumbnail.js'
export { default as UploadButton } from './UploadButton.js'
export {
  UppyContext,
  UppyContextProvider,
} from './headless/UppyContextProvider.js'
export { useDropzone } from './useDropzone.js'
export { useFileInput } from './useFileInput.js'
export { useRemoteSource } from './useRemoteSource.js'
export { useScreenCapture } from './useScreenCapture.js'
export { default as useUppyEvent } from './useUppyEvent.js'
export { default as useUppyState } from './useUppyState.js'
export { useWebcam } from './useWebcam.js'
