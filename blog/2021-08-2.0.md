Today, our tails are positively wagging with excitement about the release of
Uppy 2.0! This latest version is on average 25% smaller and up to a thousand
times faster, thanks to dropping support for IE11 and a lot of refactoring work.
We‚Äôve upgraded many dependencies, most notably Preact 8 to Preact X, greatly
improved TypeScript support and screen reader accessibility, paid technical
debt, and added support for multiple messages in the Informer plugin.

## A pup no more

Ever since the first introduction of Uppy
[five years ago](/blog/2016/07/uppy-begins/) (or 36 in
[dog-years](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/how-to-calculate-dog-years-to-human-years/)),
we‚Äôve always referred to our project as ‚Äòthe next open source file uploader for
web browsers‚Äô. The release of [Uppy 1.0](/blog/2019/04/1.0/) a little over two
years ago, however, soon led to a steep increase in adoption. Uppy now boasts
over
[24,000 stargazers on GitHub](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/stargazers),
making it the undisputed top dog in the world of file uploaders üåç

With that in mind, we felt it was high time to give Uppy some more much-needed
trimming. We want to take this opportunity to break with the past, to make the
project leaner ‚Äì and to pave the way for an even brighter future for Uppy!

## Highlights since 1.0

A lot of things have happened since we released Uppy 1.0 in April of 2019. In
case you have missed some of our 1.x releases, here is a small overview. We have
added:

- Official integrations for [Vue](/blog/2020/11/1.23/)
  ([3](/blog/2021/04/1.27/)), [Angular](/blog/2021/07/1.30/), and
  [Svelte](/blog/2020/12/1.24/)
- [Hooks](/blog/2020/12/1.24/) for the React integration
- Support for picking files from [Box](/blog/2020/11/1.23/),
  [Unsplash](/blog/2020/10/1.22/), [Facebook](/blog/2020/04/1.10/), and
  [OneDrive](/blog/2020/04/1.10/)
- [‚ÄúGhost‚Äù files](/blog/2021/05/1.29/), as part of a revamped Golden Retriever
  plugin, which makes recovering lost files even more intuitive
- Support for 25 more languages (bringing it to a total of
  [37](/docs/locales/#List-of-locale-packs))
- [Dark mode](/blog/2020/04/1.13/)
- an [Image Editor](/blog/2020/07/1.18-image-editor/)
- And four new core team members: [@ajkachnic](https://github.com/ajkachnic),
  [@mifi](https://github.com/mifi), [@aduh95](https://github.com/aduh95), and
  [@murderlon](https://github.com/murderlon)

## Smaller bundles

With 2.0, following in the footsteps of Microsoft, we are dropping support for
IE11. As a result, we are able to remove all built-in polyfills, and the new
bundle size is **25% smaller**! If you want your app to still support older
browsers (such as IE11), you may need to add the following polyfills to your
bundle:

- [abortcontroller-polyfill](https://github.com/mo/abortcontroller-polyfill)
- [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js)
- [md-gum-polyfill](https://github.com/mozdevs/mediaDevices-getUserMedia-polyfill)
- [resize-observer-polyfill](https://github.com/que-etc/resize-observer-polyfill)
- [whatwg-fetch](https://github.com/github/fetch)

If you're using a bundler, you need import these before Uppy:

```js
import 'core-js';
import 'whatwg-fetch';
import 'abortcontroller-polyfill/dist/polyfill-patch-fetch';
// Order matters here: AbortController needs fetch, which needs Promise (provided by core-js).

import 'md-gum-polyfill';
import ResizeObserver from 'resize-observer-polyfill';

window.ResizeObserver ??= ResizeObserver;

export { default } from '@uppy/core';
export * from '@uppy/core';
```

If you're using Uppy from a CDN, we now provide two bundles: one for up-to-date
browsers that do not include polyfills and use modern syntax, and one for legacy
browsers. When migrating, be mindful about the types of browsers you want to
support:

```html
<!-- Modern browsers (recommended) -->
<script src="https://releases.transloadit.com/uppy/v2.0.1/uppy.min.js"></script>

<!-- Legacy browsers (IE11+) -->
<script
	nomodule
	src="https://releases.transloadit.com/uppy/v2.0.1/uppy.legacy.min.js"
></script>
<script type="module">
	import 'https://releases.transloadit.com/uppy/v2.0.1/uppy.min.js';
</script>
```

Please note that while you may be able to get 2.0 to work in IE11 this way, we
do not officially support it anymore.

## Faster

Uppy now loads faster thanks to the decreased bundle size. With Uppy 1.0, adding
many files (hundreds or even thousands) used to take dozens of seconds. Uppy 2.0
does the same thing in mere milliseconds! So, at least for this specific use
case, we feel comfortable in claiming that you may see your loading times go
**up to a thousand times faster**.

This was made possible by avoiding having to re-render all the file components
whenever something changes, using `memoize` and `virtual-list` (allowing us to
only render what is actually visible on screen). In addition, multiple files are
now added to state in one go via `uppy.addFiles(Array)` as opposed to before,
when `uppy.addFile(File)` + `uppy.setState` were being called in a loop.

## Preact X and upgraded dependencies

We‚Äôve upgraded almost all of Uppy‚Äôs dependencies. This includes the migration to
Preact X. All plugins that depend on Preact have been upgraded from `8.2.9` to
the latest version `10.5.13`. If you‚Äôd like your custom plugin to continue
working with Uppy 2.0, it also needs to be using latest version of Preact.

Other notable upgrades include browserify to `v10`, typescript to `v4.3`,
autoprefixer to `v10`, and lerna to `v4`.

## `Plugin` is replaced with `BasePlugin` and `UIPlugin`

[`@uppy/core`][core] provided a `Plugin` class for creating plugins. This was
used for any official plugin, but also for users who want to create their own
custom plugin. However, `Plugin` always came bundled with Preact, even if the
plugin itself didn't add any UI elements.

As of Uppy 2.0.0, `Plugin` has been replaced with `BasePlugin` and `UIPlugin`.
`BasePlugin` is the minimum you need to create a plugin and `UIPlugin` adds
Preact for rendering user interfaces.

**Note:** some bundlers will include `UIPlugin` (and therefore Preact) if you
import from `@uppy/core`. To make sure this does not happen, you can import
`Uppy` and `BasePlugin` directly:

```js
import Uppy from '@uppy/core/lib/Uppy.js';
import BasePlugin from '@uppy/core/lib/BasePlugin.js';
```

[‚Äúwriting plugins‚Äù](/docs/writing-plugins) guide.

## Strict TypeScript types by default

Uppy used to have loose types by default and strict types as an opt-in. The
default export was a function that returned the `Uppy` class, and the types came
bundled with the default export (`Uppy.SomeType`).

```ts
import Uppy from '@uppy/core';
import Tus from '@uppy/tus';

const uppy = Uppy<Uppy.StrictTypes>();

uppy.use(Tus, {
	invalidOption: null, // this will make the compilation fail!
});
```

Uppy is now strictly typed by default and loose types have been removed. The
default export is the `Uppy` class and not a function. This means you need to
call `Uppy` with the `new` keyword when initializing it.

```ts
// ...

const uppy = new Uppy();

uppy.use(Tus, {
	invalidOption: null, // this will make the compilation fail!
});
```

Uppy types are now individual exports and should be imported separately.

<!-- eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars -->

```ts
import type { PluginOptions, UIPlugin, PluginTarget } from '@uppy/core';
```

### Event types

[`@uppy/core`][core] provides an [`.on`](/docs/uppy/#uppy-on-39-event-39-action)
method to listen to [events](/docs/uppy/#Events). The types for these events
were loose and allowed for invalid events to be passed, such as
`uppy.on('upload-errrOOOoooOOOOOrrrr')`.

Events have received a big update thanks to [@Hawxy](https://github.com/Hawxy),
making them more strict and accurate.

A breaking change was required to make this happen:

<!-- eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars -->

```ts
// Before:

type Meta = { myCustomMetadata: string };

// Invalid event
uppy.on<Meta>('upload-errrOOOoooOOOOOrrrr', () => {
	// ...
});

// After:

// Normal event signature
uppy.on('complete', (result) => {
	const successResults = result.successful;
});

// Custom signature
type Meta = { myCustomMetadata: string };

// Notice how the custom type has now become the second argument
uppy.on<'complete', Meta>('complete', (result) => {
	// The passed type is now merged into the `meta` types.
	const meta = result.successful[0].meta.myCustomMetadata;
});
```

Plugins that add their own events can merge with existing ones in `@uppy/core`
with `declare module '@uppy/core' { ... }`. This is a TypeScript pattern called
[module augmentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html#module-augmentation).
For instance, when using [`@uppy/dashboard`][dashboard]:

<!-- eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars -->

```ts
uppy.on('dashboard:file-edit-start', (file) => {
	const fileName = file.name;
});
```

## Batch pre-signing URLs for AWS S3 Multipart

The [`@uppy/aws-s3-multipart`][aws-s3-multipart] plugin can be used to upload
files directly to an S3 bucket using S3‚Äôs Multipart upload strategy. With this
strategy, files are chopped up in parts of 5MB+ each, so they can be uploaded
concurrently. It is also very reliable: if a single part fails to upload, only
that 5MB chunk has to be retried.

However, in Uppy 1.0, every part had to make the trip to the server to generate
a pre-signed URL. This meant that a 1GB file uploaded in 5MB chunks would
require two hundred trips to the server.

As of Uppy 2.0.0, we now pre-sign URLs in batches. That same 1GB file now only
takes fifty trips to the server (if the limit was four).

This is now the new default. Thanks to
[@martin-brennan](https://github.com/martin-brennan) for this contribution!

Do you care about reliable uploads? You could also consider [`@uppy/tus`][tus]
with a self-hosted or Transloadit Tus server. Tus can resume uploads, supports
smaller chunks, and offers increased upload speeds.

## And more

- The `.run` method on the `Uppy` instance has been removed. This method was
  already obsolete and only logged a warning. As of this major version, it no
  longer exists.
- [`@uppy/informer`][informer] now supports showing multiple notifications at
  the same time. The notifications themselves have also been improved.
- Improved screen reader accessibility for checkboxes and the 'remove file'
  button for [`@uppy/dashboard`][dashboard].
- Sort files and folders alphabetically in the Google Drive provider.
- Polished our code base with improved eslint rules, private field methods, and
  other modern JavaScript features that help us write more intention-revealing
  and safe code.
- To make Uppy more friendly towards new contributors, we have renamed our
  `master` branch to `main`.

## What future remains for 1.0?

Uppy 1.0 will continue to receive bug fixes for three more months (until
<time datetime="2021-12-01">1 December 2021</time>), security fixes for one more
year (until <time datetime="2022-09-01">1 September 2022</time>), but no more
new features after today. Exceptions are unlikely, but _can_ be made ‚Äì to
accommodate those with commercial support contracts, for example.
