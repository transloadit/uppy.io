Welcome to Day 8 of our ongoing thirty-day blog post challenge toward the **Uppy
1.0 release on April 25**! Yesterday was the 1st of April, but we had no time
for fooling around! The entire team was present for our weekly call, which was
again fully dedicated to discussing Uppy progress.

During the call, a lot of cards were moved from the _To Do_ lane into the _In
Progress_ lane â€” and some are even already _Done_. We also added a few _New_
tasks mostly related to language packs for Uppy, where we'll be asking our own
team members to update a locale of their own language. We hope other languages
will be picked up by the community!

This is what our board currently looks like:

Let's take a look at the updates we can share with you today.

## Done

- [Artur](https://transloadit.com/about/#artur) merged this
  [PR](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1393) which removed the use of
  `window.location` from Companion's client, courtesy of
  [Ife](https://transloadit.com/about/#ife).
- [Alex](https://transloadit.com/about/#alex) improved the design of the
  drag-to-upload stage. <br />

After:<br />

- [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) made sure that
  [file previews now form an even spread](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1398)
  across the width of the dashboard.

## In Progress

- We are currently investigating an
  [issue](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/issues/146) with `tus-js-client`,
  which affects uploads where the file size is larger than 500MB. Artur is now
  trying to execute a 600MB upload and then see if it crashes. After that, he
  will set chunkSize, test the upload again, and report back his findings so we
  can evaluate our next steps.

- We are also doing more research on `tus-js-client` fingerprints. Since these
  are identical for each file on React Native, the team is figuring out how to
  properly identify files on that platform, because
  [the standard file properties that tus-js-client relies on](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/blob/master/lib/node/fingerprint.js)
  are not available.

- We have our first WIP screenshot for the React Native implementation:

- [Abdel](https://transloadit.com/about/#abdel) is busy fixing the serverless
  examples where WebSockets are terminated when Uppy is deployed to Lambda

- Evgenia is working on applying for
  [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/open-source?ref=pricing)'s open
  source program, so we can hopefully test Uppy even more and make sure that 1.0
  is without any issues.

- Ife is writing tests for the implementation of the `tus-js-client` URL
  storage.

That's all the updates I have for you today. See you tomorrow for
[Day 9](/blog/2019/04/liftoff-09/) of our 30 Days to Liftoff!
