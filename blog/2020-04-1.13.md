Releases 1.11 through 1.13 introduced a bunch of major new features and
bugfixes. Let's go through the main ones!

## Dark mode

A little while ago we’ve
[announced work in progress](https://mobile.twitter.com/uppy_io/status/1221070643543838721)
on Dark Mode for the Dashboard. We're happy to tell you it’s live now! You can
try it out on [the Dashboard example page](/examples/dashboard/).

  <source src="/img/blog/1.13/dark-mode-auto.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

There are three options available:

- `light` — the default
- `dark`
- `auto` — will respect the user’s system settings and switch automatically

```js
uppy.use(Dashboard, {
	theme: 'dark',
});
```

## Custom meta fields

This is big one! Thanks to @galli-leo, you can now add custom fields to the
Dashboard meta editor, such as `<input type="tel">`, `<select>` or
`<input type="checkbox">`, like this:

```js
uppy.use(Dashboard, {
	trigger: '#pick-files',
	metaFields: [
		{
			id: 'caption',
			name: 'Caption',
			placeholder: 'describe what the image is about',
		},
		{
			id: 'public',
			name: 'Public',
			render: ({ value, onChange }, h) => {
				return h('input', {
					type: 'checkbox',
					onChange: (ev) => onChange(ev.target.checked ? 'on' : 'off'),
					defaultChecked: value === 'on',
				});
			},
		},
	],
});
```

See [the docs](/docs/dashboard/#metaFields) and
[PR #2147](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/2147) for details.

## Google Docs support in Companion

In the past, Uppy could already import files from Google Drive using Companion.
However, files from Google Docs are not _really_ files, and could not be
imported. That was confusing for users: some of their files simply didn't
appear!

Companion now automagically converts GSuite documents, such as docs,
spreadsheets and presentations, to `.docx`, `.xlsx` and `.ppt` files that can be
opened in various applications. The current list of conversions is hardcoded to:

```json
{
	"application/vnd.google-apps.document": ".docx",
	"application/vnd.google-apps.drawing": ".png",
	"application/vnd.google-apps.script": ".json",
	"application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet": ".xlsx",
	"application/vnd.google-apps.presentation": ".ppt"
}
```

This may be configurable in a future release.

Note that only documents under 10MB are converted. This is a limitation set by
the Google Drive API.

## AWS S3

The Aws S3 plugin now handles uploads internally, instead of deferring to XHR
Upload. This change fixes many bugs with Aws S3. See
[PR #2060](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/2147) for details.

## Locales

Polish, Croatian and Romanian language packs have been added by @alfatv, @dkisic
and @akizor :tada:

## Exifr in Thumbnail Generator

[@MikeKovarik](https://github.com/MikeKovarik) created an awesome library called
[Exifr](https://github.com/MikeKovarik/exifr), useful for extracting EXIF image
data. He was kind enough to submit a PR that replaces Uppy’s internal fork of
`exif-js` with `exifr`. Our thumbnail generation is now faster and more robust!
See [PR 2140](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/2140) for details.
