We're reaching the final stretch of our '30 Days to Liftoff' blog post
challenge. After a refreshing weekend, the entire team is ready to give it their
all over the next ten days to ensure that **Uppy 1.0 reaches its April 25**
release date.

Since we're starting the week strong and prepared, let's take a quick glance at
how our Uppy dashboard is looking.

There are still a few unique, and possibly daunting, tasks left for the
remainder of the development cycle, but the team is taking each issue in stride
and adding features with ease.

- [Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju)
  [fixed a bug](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/commit/9f02d749b9aa4095e5871713ea2f25a716a21539)
  on the React Native side of things to get rid of an error that was present on
  one of our Android examples. Additionally, he made some name changes in a
  number of files — changing `serverUrl` to `companionUrl` and `serverPattern`
  to `companionAllowedHosts`.

- [Artur](https://github.com/arturi) and [Kevin](https://github.com/kvz) will
  continue pairing on
  [language packs](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1443) throughout
  today.

- Ife is also still tackling the
  [large file size upload issue](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/issues/146)
  we're having with React Native. He managed to find the source of the issue,
  but Both Ife and [Marius](https://github.com/Acconut) will be investigating
  how best to move on from here.

- [Renée](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop) continues working on making Robodog
  work with an inline dashboard. They plan to have a demo and documentation up
  and running sometime today.

- The
  [drag and drop improvements](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1440)
  being made by [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) will also continue today,
  with some of her current improvements being the removal of the flickering
  issue and a nicer background design while using the feature.

- [Alex](https://github.com/nqst)
  [discovered an issue](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/1447) with
  the filter field when using Google Drive on the Dashboard.

Our goal is in sight, so we're starting to get pretty excited! Keep us in your
thoughts by giving us a follow on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/uppy_io) or

[Day 22](/blog/2019/04/liftoff-22/) is up next, so you can look forward to
another lovely post from Kevin!
