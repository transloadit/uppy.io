Hi! Another month ‚Äî a new Uppy release üéâ

_Note: current latest release is actually `0.19`, but this post got delayed, so
we are publishing it first. `0.19` post is coming next._

## New documentation

Documentation for Uppy has been re-written, and now features chapters on Uppy‚Äôs
settings and API, using various plugins, and running Uppy Server. Check it out:
<https://uppy.io/docs/>. More chapters to come!

## The GoldenRetriever

The GoldenRetriever has been released as a public beta. For details, please
refer to the previous post,
[The GoldenRetriever: Making uploads survive browser crashes](https://uppy.io/blog/2017/07/golden-retriever/),
but the gist is: when enabled, this plugin will save uppy-state to localStorage
on every change, and then if your browser crashes, or you accidentaly navigate
away from a tab,later when you return, your uploads will resume like nothing
happened. Spoiler: it uses Service Workers and IndexedDB.

## Multipart uploader is now XHRUpload

`Multipart` has been replaced by a more flexible `XHRUpload`, so that other
plugins, like `AwsS3`, can depend on it.

## AwsS3

The `AwsS3` plugin can be used to upload files directly to an S3 bucket.

As of now, the AwsS3 plugin ‚Äúdecorates‚Äù the `XHRUpload` plugin. To upload files
directly to S3, both the `XHRUpload` and `AwsS3` plugins must be used:

```js
// No options have to be provided to the XHRUpload plugin,
// the S3 plugin will configure it.
uppy.use(XHRUpload);
uppy.use(AwsS3, {
	// Options for S3
});
```

Please find [more info and examples](https://uppy.io/docs/aws-s3/) in the docs.

## Transloadit `getAssemblyOptions`

We‚Äôve added a `getAssemblyOptions` function option to the `Transloadit` plugin.
This option can return an object or a Promise for an object to configure the
Transloadit assembly. The returned object can contain params, a signature, and
fields.

`getAssemblyOptions` is called on each file, so each file can return a different
set of options. Files that returned the same options are bundled together and
run through a single assembly. Files that return different options will be run
through different assemblies.

This means that it is now possible to make assembly parameters depend on user
input from eg. the `MetaData` plugin, and have different parameters for
different files. It‚Äôs now also possible to generate very short-lived signatures
on the server when an upload starts, by calling fetch inside the
`getAssemblyOptions` hook.

## Webcam: 1, 2, 3 smile!

Webcam plugin now has a new exciting feature ‚Äî ‚è± `countdown`. If you set it to
3 seconds, for example, then after pressing the capture button, Uppy will count
to 3 before actually taking your selfie, so you‚Äôll have the time to fix your
hair:

```js
uppy.use(Webcam, { countdown: 3 });
```

## Tons of Uppy Server improvements

- Uppy Server uses Informer to display errors;
- Pictures from Instagram carousels show up inline;
- Uppy server now returns an `i-am` containing its instance url;
- Disable socket channel from restarting an already completed file download;
- Uppy client whitelisting has been made optional, you may use wildcard instead;
- Added feature to set master oauth redirect uri for multiple uppy-server
  instances;
- Added options to support for redis session storage on the standalone server;
- Uppy-server can be started as a binary `uppy-server`;
- Downloaded files are stored based on uuids;
- Upload state is stored on redis (useful for Goldern Retriever plugin).
