It's day 17 already of our '30 Days to Liftoff' blog post challenge and the
**launch of Uppy 1.0 on April 25** is coming closer by the day. The Uppy team is
dealing with the big tasks now, so the updates might seem a little scant!

## Done

- [Artur](https://github.com/arturi) updated the
  [React Native](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/988) UI example. This
  is what the new UI looks like:

- [Alex](https://github.com/nqst) updated the focus styles on the Uppy
  Dashboard, making it look quite a bit sleeker than it did before. Here's a
  before and after view of the Dashboard focus styles:

## In Progress

- Artur is reviewing PRs, reporting errors and testing Uppy in response to the
  team’s feedback.

- Alex continues improving Uppy's UI and has recently been refactoring CSS code,
  while [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) keeps charging at the
  [many accessibility issues](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/created_by/nqst)
  that are still open.

- Evgenia is also working on the new drag/drop implementation, which will
  include a new _Drop Here_ placeholder and not experience any flickering. And
  as if that weren't enough, she is having a go at `drop folder` support for
  cross-browser compatibility as well, so that it won’t be relying on DOM
  manipulation in our Preact components.

- [Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju) is updating this
  [PR](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/pull/73), which deals with
  supporting resumability for Node.js environments.

That's all from us today. As I mentioned, we are now focusing on the big tasks
and as a result, our daily list of updates might sometimes be a little shorter
than usual. Remember to keep tabs on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/uppy_io)
or [RSS](https://uppy.io/blog/atom.xml) for more Uppy updates.
[Day 18](/blog/2019/04/liftoff-18/) is coming up next!
