We are happy to announce version 2.0 of Companion! ðŸŽ‰ After maintaining and
improving the 1.x series for over a year, we're now releasing a major version
bump on the Companion package. The drive on this release is mainly towards
fixing some terminology inconsistencies and aligning with Node.js LTS to ease
the maintenance burden.

So what are the changes you can expect with Companion 2.0?

## Node >= v10

Node.js 8.x has reached end-of-life. Consequently, Companion 2.0 has dropped
support for Node.js 6.x and Node.js 8.x, and now requires that you run at least
Node.js 10.20.1.

## Renamed provider options

Pre 2.0, there were inconsistencies in relation to the provider names. In some
places, the Google Drive provider was referred to as _google_ (e.g., in
`providerOptions`) while in some other places, it was referred to as _drive_
(e.g., the server endpoints `/drive/list`). Companion 2.0 now consistently uses
the name _drive_ everywhere. Similarly, the OneDrive provider was made to have
the consistent name _onedrive_.

## Changed Redirect URIs

On the topic of consistent naming, we have also made some changes to the
redirect URIs supplied during the OAuth process. For example, in the case of
Google Drive, the form of the old redirect URI was
`https://mycompanionwebsite.tld/connect/google/callback`. In Companion 2.0, this
is now changed to `https://mycompanionwebsite.tld/drive/redirect`. This is a
Breaking Change: you will need to make the corresponding changes to your
redirect URIs on your Providers' API Dashboards.

## Compatibility with Uppy 1.x client

Companion 2.0 is compatible with any Uppy 1.x version, so you don't have to
worry about upgrading your Uppy client installations when you upgrade Companion
on your server.

## Will Companion v1 still receive updates?

Companion 1.x will continue to receive security patches until March 1, 2021.

## Migrating from Companion 1.x to 2.x

Given the breaking changes, we've created a
[migration tutorial for upgrading from Companion v1 to v2](https://uppy.io/docs/companion/#Migrating-v1-to-v2).
