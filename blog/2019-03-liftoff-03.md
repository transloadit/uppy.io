Two days ago, we announced the **upcoming launch of Uppy 1.0 on April 25**,
kicking off our thirty-day blog post challenge to keep you updated on everything
that is going on. Here's day three for you!

<!--truncate-->

We're still mostly busy tying up any remaining loose ends before April 1, when
we'll really start our coding speedrun towards 1.0:

## Done

[Artur](https://github.com/arturi) merged two pull requests from
[Renée](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop). The
[first](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1375) one aims to use
Transloadit Templates and demo keys for the `transloadit-textarea` example, and
the [second](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1374) one makes error
reporting across different locales more flexible.

Artur also added a [GitHub-comment-inspired demo](/examples/markdown-snippets/).
Add a file attachment to your markdown, and it will be uploaded and converted to
a thumbnail that's displayed inside your post, no matter the media type (audio
turns into artwork, images are resized, videos thumbnailed, etc.).

[Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju) reviewed and merged this
[pull request](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1366), which updates the
callback URIs to reflect their correct location in Companion. Thanks to
[HughbertD](https://github.com/HughbertD) for that one!

We also celebrated Evgenia submitting her first two PRs:
[one](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1382) to make sure that tooltips
can no longer overflow inside the Uppy container, and
[another](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1383) that removes the
jumpiness when Uppy loads.

## In Progress

Renée is working hard to fix outdated warnings in our examples. Other than that,
the team has been dealing with a Companion issue that invalid access tokens are
given out when you select a provider to receive your file from. The aim is to
return 401 for invalid access tokens, so that the `/authorized` endpoint can be
deprecated. You can track the progress of this issue in its
[pull request](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1298).

## To Do

The biggest update that will be part of Uppy 1.0 is support for React Native.
Yesterday, Renée, Artur, Ife, [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) and
[Kevin](https://github.com/kvz) had a call and talked extensively about what
would be needed to have a minimum viable product. They settled on the following
six subtasks, which I'm copying directly from their notes: :)

```markdown
MVP for React Native support should:

- [ ] get a link provider example to work, including showing Companion progress
      and resumability
- [ ] get its own UI, (re)written for RN
- [ ] make websocket progress from Companion work (see:
      https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/network#websocket-support)
- [ ] have an example with buttons for resumability & a progress bar
- [ ] have resumability support within 20 min (easily tested by disabling WiFi
      on your workstation while uploading to master.tus.io)
- [ ] have an example with basic file previews (Uppy RN itself likely does not
      offer previews)
```

That's all the updates I have for you today. See you tomorrow for
[Day 4](/blog/2019/03/liftoff-04/) of our 30 Days to Liftoff!
