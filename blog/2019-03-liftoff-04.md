## Done

We haven't even hit April 1 yet and the 'Done' section of the project dashboard
is already getting plenty of love! Today, [Alex](https://github.com/nqst)
finished designing a specialized header for visitors of Uppy.io and
[Tus.io](https://tus.io) to inform them about the discount on
[Transloadit](https://transloadit.com/) services they can receive :wink:

[Adbel](https://github.com/Kiloreux) started a dialogue with the team regarding
[Docker secrets](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/138), seeing as
[an issue](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/1295) about this was
reported. He decided that the best course of action was to follow the Kubernetes
[best practices](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#best-practices)
and add a `Secret` resource to contain the environment variables.

## In Progress

One of the more exciting updates of this day was also contributed by Alex, with
his impressive pre-alpha sketch of a new homepage for Uppy. Despite only being a
work in progress, the entire team has been overjoyed with how it's turning out!

[Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju) has been focused on
[fixing hanging Instagram files uploaded through Companion](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1274/files)
and our content team's own [Samuel](https://github.com/samuelayo) added examples
for
[handling uploads in Node.js, and in Python (using the Flask microframework)](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1389).

And that's Day 4 complete! Catch up with us
[tomorrow](/blog/2019/03/liftoff-05/), as we take this thing into our first
weekend of the 30 Days to Liftoff! And of course, if you want to keep yourself
