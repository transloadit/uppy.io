<!--retext-simplify ignore very-->

Last Christmas, we gave you [Uppy 1.24](https://uppy.io/blog/2020/12/1.24/), but
this very next year, we‚Äôll take it away (since it‚Äôs outdated by now) and give
you a brand-new Uppy 2.3 üéÅ!

After the [release](https://uppy.io/blog/2021/08/2.0/) of our latest major
version, 2.0.0, we‚Äôve been busy with many things. First of all is the
long-awaited Audio plugin to record and upload live audio directly. We then
worked on adding a fast and efficient streaming interface to Companion and made
Unsplash production ready. Housekeeping was also part of the job: we made Status
Bar improvements, moved from npm to Yarn 3, did some refactoring, and updated
dependencies.

Last but not least, we got the issue count down from around 110 since 2.0.0 to
around 45 now.

## Audio plugin

Uppy now has a new `@uppy/audio` plugin for recording audio memos, sounds,
jingling bells, Christmas carols, and all your holiday cheer. Check it out on
the [demo page](https://uppy.io/examples/dashboard/).

## `@uppy/unsplash` is now production ready

The Unsplash plugin has received an update, providing attribution to the image
authors and adding some polish to make it look better. Being fully brand
compliant with Unsplash means it‚Äôs now production ready. You can demo the plugin
on the [website](https://uppy.io/examples/dashboard) or read the
[docs](https://uppy.io/docs/unsplash/).

## New streaming interface for Companion

[Companion][companion] handles the server-to-server communication between your
server and file storage providers such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Instagram, and
the like. This bypasses the client (so a 5 GB video isn‚Äôt eating into your
users‚Äô data plans) and files are directly uploaded to the final destination.
Companion is made to be effortlessly integrate-able with Uppy.

It used to work by downloading the requested file from a remote provider on the
server to then start uploading it to the destination. This did the job, but it‚Äôs
wasn‚Äôt ideal.

We now built streaming support into Companion, which means the download and
upload can happen simultaneously. This can result in **two times faster
uploads**, because we no longer have to wait for files to finish downloading
before starting the upload process. It‚Äôs especially useful for large files and
removes the need for a lot of storage space on the server, as data will be
buffered in memory.

You can enable this by setting `streamingUpload` in the Companion
[options](https://uppy.io/docs/companion/#Options).

**NOTE:** Streaming is turned off by default. Do not turn it on yet if you‚Äôre
using TUS for uploads, due to
[this tus-js-client bug](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/issues/275).

Interested in using Companion? You can use Transloadit-hosted Companion on every
[Plan](https://transloadit.com/pricing/).

## Status Bar error state improvements

The Status Bar plugin would get confused about upload errors in Uppy, and we‚Äôve
addressed this:

- The error state is now shown in case of only _one_ failed file instead of
  _all_ failed files. The plugin used to get stuck in the uploading state when a
  single file failed.
- Added ‚ÄúX of X files uploaded‚Äù below ‚ÄúUpload failed‚Äù for extra context.
- Improved the error details button styling in the Status Bar and the file info
  card.
- Status Bar state is set to complete if the user manually removes the failed
  files.

## Internal housekeeping

### Yarn v3 instead of npm

We‚Äôve switched the Uppy repo to Yarn 3 to improve package install performance.
With our complex dependency graph and over thirty packages in a monorepo, we are
seeing install times reduced by more than a few minutes!

We are using [Corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack) to make sure all
Uppy contributors are using the same version of Yarn. If you are an Uppy
contributor, please run the following commands to enable Corepack:

```sh
corepack -v || npm i -g corepack # install Corepack if not already installed
yarn -v || corepack enable # install Yarn through Corepack if not already installed
yarn || corepack yarn install # install npm dependencies using yarn
```

### Refactor locale scripts & generate types and docs

This is an internal change, but important nonetheless. Our locales now live in a
separate `locale.js` file for every plugin instead of `this.defaultLocale` in
the class. The docs and types are automatically updated when we add or remove
new locale strings.

[View the PR](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/3276).

### Automated release scripts

A lot of things need to happen when we‚Äôre publishing a new release. A complete
redo of the automation script is now available for quick and secure releases.

Here are some highlights:

- Releaser runs `yarn release` and will get a series of
  [prompts](https://github.com/terkelg/prompts) to set up a release.
- A changelog will be generated.
- The contributions table will be updated.
- GitHub Actions will create a release candidate pull request.
- When approved, GitHub Actions automatically merges, publishes to the npm
  public registry, and creates CDN bundles.
