In Uppy 1.27 we’ve added a new `@uppy/drop-target` plugin, enabled support for
Vue 3, introduced dynamic `metaFields` option for Dashboard, Google Drive now
lists documents that have been shared with you.

## Drop Target

With `@uppy/drop-target` it is now possible to turn your whole app / page (or
any other element, like `<textarea>`, for instance) into a drag-and-drop area:

```js
uppy.use(DropTarget, {
	target: document.body,
});
```

## Google Drive “Shared with me”

If you connect Uppy to Google Drive, you’ll now see a new virtual folder called
“Shared with me” — there you’ll find (hard to guess, I know), documents that
have been shared with you.

[PR #2758](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/2758).

## Dashboard Dynamic `metaFields`

Sometimes you may want to show specific meta fields for certain type of files.
For instance, you may want to show location and alt attribute for images. Now,
instead of setting a fixed array of fields, you can pass a function that will be
called for each file, returning an array of fields from it:

```js
.use(Dashboard, {
  trigger: '#pick-files',
  metaFields: (file) => {
    const fields = [{ id: 'name', name: 'File name' }]
    if (file.type.startsWith('image/')) {
      fields.push({ id: 'location', name: 'Photo Location' })
      fields.push({ id: 'alt', name: 'Alt text' })
    }
    return fields
  },
})
```

See [Dashboard `metaFields`](https://uppy.io/docs/dashboard/#metaFields) docs
for details.

## Vue 3

`@uppy/vue` integration now supports Vue 3! This is done by checking the
arguments of the `render` function and determining whether it is using Vue 2 or
3, and then returning the appropriate rendering method.

[PR #2755](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/2755).

## Companion CORS and Better Testing

In Companion, we’ve improved unit testing DX
([#2827](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/2827)) and switched to using
the `cors` module instead of custom cors logic
([#2823](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/2823)).

@coreprocess submited a fix that allows Companion to serve on a subpath
([#2797](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/2797)), and added Redis pubsub
scope setting ([#2804](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/2804))!

## npm 7

We’ve finally upgraded our monorepo to npm 7 and
[Workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces). If you are a
contributor, please upgrade `npm install npm -g`, as npm 7 is now required for
the Uppy repo.

[PR #2835](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/2835)

## New Linter Rules

Quite a few new rules have been added to our eslint-config, which is now mostly
`eslint-config-transloadit` with some custom uppy-specific overrides.

[PR #2796](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/2796)
