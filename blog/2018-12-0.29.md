`0.29` brings bug fixes and improvements, while we are busy working on Uppy
React Native support (which first had to
[land in the js client for our resumable file upload protocol: tus.io](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client#react-native-support))
and a Preset (still debating the name) which will make it easier to leverage
Transloadit's encoding platform, and offer a smooth migration path for users not
yet on Uppy. The highlights of this release are: separating Core and Plugin
styles, more accurate progress reporting by factoring in sizes across files,
adding a `responseType` option for XHR Upload, and fixing visual Webcam bugs.

## Separate Core and Plugin styles

**‚ö†Ô∏è breaking**

When installing `uppy` and Plugins from npm, you had to include their styles.
Prior to this release, you only had to include the Plugin‚Äôs CSS, say, for
`@uppy/webcam`:

```js
import Uppy from '@uppy/core';
import Webcam from '@uppy/webcam';
import '@uppy/webcam/dist/style.css';
```

Each plugin's file contained the Core styles. If you added multiple plugins, the
core styles ended up being duplicated. This bloated file sizes and could even
break styles entirely because of CSS's precedence rules.

Now, you have to include ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù styles from `@uppy/core` as well:

```js
import Uppy from '@uppy/core';
import Webcam from '@uppy/webcam';
import '@uppy/core/dist/style.css'; // <-- add this separately and one time only
import '@uppy/webcam/dist/style.css';
```

Thus, the Core styles are only included once. `@uppy/core` styles must be
included before Plugin styles.

Please see the [documentation](https://uppy.io/docs/) for the Plugin you are
using to find out whether it requires a CSS file to work. Generally speaking, UI
plugins, such as the Dashboard, Webcam and Status Bar, need a CSS file, while
utility plugins, such as Tus or XHR Upload, don‚Äôt.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important things to remember:

1. Dashboard is a universal UI that comes with the Status Bar and Informer
   Plugins built in, and as such, Dashboard styles already come with the
   Informer and Status Bar styles.
2. Dashboard also ships with ‚ÄúRemote Provider‚Äù styles ‚Äî you don‚Äôt need to
   include anything besides `@uppy/dashboard/dist/style.css` for Google Drive,
   Instagram and Dropbox to work. However, the Url and Webcam plugins still have
   to be included manually. Here‚Äôs an example:

```js
import Uppy from '@uppy/core';
import Dashboard from '@uppy/webcam';
import GoogleDrive from '@uppy/google-drive';
import Webcam from '@uppy/webcam';
import Url from '@uppy/url';

// Core and Dashboard styles, then Webcam and Url, but not for GoogleDrive ‚Äî
// those come with Dashboard
import '@uppy/core/dist/style.css';
import '@uppy/dashboard/dist/style.css';
import '@uppy/webcam/dist/style.css';
import '@uppy/url/dist/style.css';
```

## Using File Sizes For Progress Calculation

When possible, file sizes are now used for calculating the total progress.
Before, we‚Äôve used uploaded percentage for each file. Meaning that if you were
uploading four files ‚Äî and three small were already uploaded, while one very
large file was still in progress ‚Äî Uppy might still display progress as being
90%. Long story short, Uppy now has a more accurate progress bar üöÄ

Some internal details, if you are interested:

1. If there are files without sizes, the average size of all other files is
   assumed for the unsized files.
2. If there are no files with sizes, the percentage is just based on the
   percentages of the unsized files.

## `responseType` For XHR Upload

When using XHR Upload, you can now configure the XMLHttpRequest `.responseType`
value. This allows the S3 Plugin to tell Firefox not to log XML errors when
getting empty responses, so it finally fixes the spurious warnings that were
caused by this, see [#518](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/518).

Because AwsS3 now sets `responseType`: `'text'`, we can no longer use the
`responseXML` property. We already did text based parsing for successful
responses, and will now do the same for error responses.
