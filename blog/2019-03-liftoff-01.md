When we [started working on Uppy](/blog/2016/07/uppy-begins/) back in early
2016, all we had was an idea and the shared desire to launch file uploading into
a new age. We had already been laying the groundwork with the development of
[tus.io](https://tus.io/) and felt that its robust back-end deserved a front-end
just as robust, modern and user-friendly.

But what about open? We initially thought about building a proprietary uploader
that would work exclusively with Transloadit's commercial service, but we
quickly turned around on it. We knew this could have a real impact. So, just
like we did with Tus, we decided to make our new project open source. Three
years, [16.000 stargazers](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/stargazers) and a
thriving community later — and we could not be happier. Well, apart from one
thing: **getting Uppy 1.0 out the door** has proven harder than expected. Issues
keep piling up, which led us down countless sidetracks and hurt our capacity to
hammer out those final design goals.

But now it's time for all that to change. That's why, starting today, we are
allocating all of Transloadit's resources into making a big final push and
getting Uppy ready for liftoff. Our goal is to launch on **April 25**, exactly
thirty days from now.

We'll need all the help we can get, so for the next thirty days, everyone here
at Transloadit is going to be working exclusively on tasks related to Uppy 1.0.
That means the Uppy core team (obviously) and tus core team, our SDK teams, as
well as our infra & API engineers, designers, content writers, and the founders
themselves — we'll all be chipping in and doing our part to ensure liftoff in
thirty days. We're even adding someone new to the Uppy team in April. A warm
welcome to [Evgenia Karunus](https://github.com/lakesare) :)

## A new post every day

We have added all tasks to a project board and thought it might be a fun idea to
keep you updated on our day-to-day progress. So, we set ourselves an additional
challenge: apart from getting Uppy ready for 1.0, we're also going to **write a
blog post about it every day**, for thirty days. Starting with this one.

A post each day may prove hard to do, but we think it's worth a try. It really
fits with the open way in which we have been developing Uppy for the past few
years, and gives you a look behind the scenes as we're getting ready for the
home stretch. And hopefully, we also succeed in spreading the word even further,
reaching people that don't yet know about Uppy, but would be happy to!

## What's Uppy with you?

We'd love to hear what you think. Whether it is about Uppy in general, or
specific issues you feel cannot be forgotten before 1.0, or maybe even about
this blog post challenge itself — leave a comment here, use our
[forum](https://community.transloadit.com/c/uppy) directly (it also hosts the
comments), or let us know on Twitter via [@uppy_io](http://twitter.com/uppy_io/)
or [@transloadit](http://twitter.com/transloadit/).

We can use your help! As we've said, we're looking to spread the word so any
retweet, blog post, star, you name it, is gonna be double extra appreciated.
Also, [issue busting](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues) is going to
slow down as we're about to head deep into the remaining design goals (e.g.
React Native). So, if you want to lend a hand with that, we'd owe you big time!

See you tomorrow for the first progress update on
[Day 2](/blog/2019/03/liftoff-02/) of our 30 Days to Liftoff!
