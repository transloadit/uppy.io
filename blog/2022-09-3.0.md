Uppy is turning three! When you‚Äôre counting in
[dog years](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/how-to-calculate-dog-years-to-human-years/)
‚Äì which we most certainly are ‚Äì that‚Äôs 29 already. An age like that signifies
proper adulthood. For Uppy, this means it‚Äôs ready to stay loyal, but without the
silly mistakes (read: bugs). Uppy also underwent (ESM) surgery to keep it
strolling by your side in the current ecosystem, and received other behavioral
improvements üê∂

<!--truncate-->

TL;DR: ESM transition, native mobile camera, new Remote Sources plugin, sweeping
Companion rewrite and streaming support, `async`/`await` everything, React 18
and Vue 3 support, all examples rewritten.

## ESM surgery

[ECMAScript Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)
(ESM) are the future and we‚Äôre ready to adopt it. Benefits over CommonJS
include: improved security, better tree shaking, and a syntax that can be
understood natively by browsers, which can greatly improve the DX if the tools
are configured to take advantage of that.

Following in the footsteps of many other packages, we now only ship Uppy core
and its plugins as ESM. For Uppy 2.x, we were shipping CommonJS.

If you are already using ESM or the CDN builds, nothing changes for you! If you
are using CommonJS, you may have to add extra tooling for everything to work, or
consider refactoring your codebase to ESM. Please refer to the
[Pure ESM package gist](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c)
for more information and help on how to do that.

## Less integration code with the new remote sources preset

We‚Äôve introduced a new Uppy preset plugin,
[`@uppy/remote-sources`](/docs/remote-sources), which combines Instagram,
Facebook, Google Drive, Box, Unsplash, Dropbox, One Drive, Zoom and any other
remote cloud sources that Uppy will support in the future. The plugin only works
with Dashboard and allows you to enable all the above sources in a single line.

Before, you had to manually include every cloud provider / remote source:

```js
uppy
	.use(Instagram, {
		companionUrl: COMPANION_URL,
		companionAllowedHosts: COMPANION_ALLOWED_HOSTS,
	})
	.use(GoogleDrive, {
		companionUrl: COMPANION_URL,
		companionAllowedHosts: COMPANION_ALLOWED_HOSTS,
	})
	.use(OneDrive, {
		companionUrl: COMPANION_URL,
		companionAllowedHosts: COMPANION_ALLOWED_HOSTS,
	})
	.use(Instagram, {
		companionUrl: COMPANION_URL,
		companionAllowedHosts: COMPANION_ALLOWED_HOSTS,
	})
	.use(Facebook, {
		companionUrl: COMPANION_URL,
		companionAllowedHosts: COMPANION_ALLOWED_HOSTS,
	})
	.use(Unsplash, {
		companionUrl: COMPANION_URL,
		companionAllowedHosts: COMPANION_ALLOWED_HOSTS,
	});
// ...
```

After:

```js
uppy.use(RemoteSources, { companionUrl: COMPANION_URL });
```

To get started, check out the [`RemoteSources` docs](/docs/remote-sources).

## Robodog ends its service

Uppy is flexible and extensible through plugins, but the integration code could
sometimes prove daunting. This is what brought [Robodog](/docs/robodog/) to
life. It served as an alternative with the same features, but with a more
ergonomic and minimal API.

It did, however, come with its own set of new problems:

- Robodog tries to do the exact same thing as Uppy, but looks like an entirely
  different product.
- Users are faced with a confusing choice between using Robodog or using Uppy
  directly.
- Robodog is more ergonomic because it‚Äôs limited. When hitting such a limit, the
  user has to refactor everything to Uppy using plugins.

This has now led us to deprecating Robodog and embracing Uppy for its strong
suits: modularity and flexibility. At the same time, we‚Äôre also introducing
something to take away some of the repetitive integration code:
[`@uppy/remote-sources`](/docs/remote-sources).

Are you using Robodog in your code base? You can check out the
[migration guide](https://uppy.io/docs/guides/migration-guides/#migrate-from-robodog-to-uppy-plugins)
to see how you can transition to Uppy plugins without losing functionality. We
have committed ourselves to extending Robodog support for one year to give our
users more time to migrate.

## Native mobile camera

As you are probably aware, Uppy‚Äôs Webcam plugin provides a nice UI for desktop
devices to take pictures and record videos. Up until 3.0, the same UI was
utilized on mobile as well.

Since most mobile devices have a system UI for taking pictures and recording
videos ‚Äì which is usually better than any custom solution we can offer ‚Äì we‚Äôve
introduced a new option called `mobileNativeCamera` for the Webcam plugin:

```js
uppy.use(Webcam, {
	mobileNativeCamera: isMobile({ tablet: true }),
});
```

By default, it uses the [`is-mobile`](https://github.com/juliangruber/is-mobile)
package to detect mobile devices, like smartphones and tablets, but you can
manually set this option to `true` or `false` if you wish. When enabled, instead
of the usual Camera/Webcam Uppy UI, users will be presented with buttons that
open their device‚Äôs native camera interface:

![Uppy native camera UI](/img/blog/3.0/native-camera.jpg)

[`videoConstraints.facingMode`](/docs/webcam/#videoConstraints) is also
supported by this option via the
[`capture`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/capture)
attribute (in the browsers and devices that respect it).

```js
uppy.use(Webcam, {
	videoConstraints: {
		facingMode: 'user',
	},
});
```

The same applies to [`modes`](/docs/webcam/#modes), allowing you to enable only
video or only photos.

## Devotedly stable

Since the Uppy 2.7.0 release, **we‚Äôve fixed over 95 bugs!** This includes fixes
to bugs that made uploading less stable, documentation corrections, and
dependency upgrades.

## Companion turns 4.0

Everyone‚Äôs favorite Companion also received some love.

### Streaming upload

Streaming upload can now also be enabled in Companion when using Tus. This comes
with greatly improved upload speeds and allows uploading up to hundreds of
gigabytes without needing a large server storage. We found that this improves
speeds by about 37% for a Google Drive upload of a 1 GB file
([source](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/4046#issuecomment-1235697937)).
This feature was also available before Companion 4.0, but it didn‚Äôt work with
Tus until now.

With streaming upload disabled (default), the whole file will be downloaded
first. The upload will then start when the download has completely finished.

When streaming upload is enabled, Companion will start downloading the file from
the provider (such as Google Drive), while at the same time starting the upload
to the destination (such as Tus), and sending every chunk of data consecutively.

For more information, see the [Companion docs](/docs/companion/).

### Event emitter

Companion now has a server-side event emitter that can be used to detect when
uploads start, finish and fail, without having to depend on the client (so it
works even when users have closed their browser).

Example code:

```js
const { app, emitter } = companion.app(options);

emitter.on('upload-start', ({ token }) => {
	console.log('Upload started', token);

	function onUploadEvent({ action, payload }) {
		if (action === 'success') {
			emitter.off(token, onUploadEvent); // avoid listener leak
			console.log('Upload finished', token, payload.url);
		} else if (action === 'error') {
			emitter.off(token, onUploadEvent); // avoid listener leak
			console.error('Upload failed', payload);
		}
	}
	emitter.on(token, onUploadEvent);
});
```

### Internal improvements

Companion‚Äôs internal request code and Providers have been rewritten to
`async`/`await`, which has greatly simplified and reduced the amount of code.
This will lead to less bugs and security issues, and make it easier to implement
new custom Providers.

We have also replaced the deprecated
[`request`](https://github.com/request/request) library with
[`got`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got). This also removed the need for
[`purest`](https://github.com/simov/purest).

### And more!

- [Compressor](/docs/compressor) is officially stable. The Compressor plugin for
  Uppy optimizes images (JPEG, PNG), saving on average up to 60% in size. It has
  proven itself through extensive battle testing.
- [AWS S3 Multipart](/docs/aws-s3-multipart) also became more stable this
  release, as a result of us hammering out some of the last edge cases with lots
  of files and/or huge files.
- React 18 is now supported in [`@uppy/react`](/docs/react), Vue 3 is supported
  for [`@uppy/vue`](/docs/vue), and Angular 14 for
  [`@uppy/angular`](/docs/angular).
- Our [examples](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/tree/main/examples) have
  received a fresh round of updates to keep them relevant.

That‚Äôs it from us for now! As you can see, Uppy may be slowly turning into an
old dog, but we‚Äôre still committed to keep teaching it new tricks. We hope
you‚Äôll enjoy this latest major release, and all the features and improvements it
includes. We can‚Äôt wait to hear your thoughts about it on
