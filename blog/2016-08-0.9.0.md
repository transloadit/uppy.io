We have just released Uppy 0.9.0. This release features some changes that we
think you will be very excited about. Let's see what's new!

<!--truncate-->

## Ability to pause uploads, progress indicators & ETA

The most visible feature that has been added is the ability to pause and resume
file uploads.

<img alt="dashboard UI with files uploading and a pause all button" src="/img/blog/0.9/upload-resume.jpg" className="border" />

The upload dashboard now contains more information about uploads, such as the
time remaining until an upload is finished. We have also added circular progress
indicators to give better visual feedback on an upload's progress.

## Remote file uploads

Remote file uploading is now working again.

## Informer interface

We have added a new `Informer` plugin (tested with `Dashboard`, should also work
anywhere else) that listens to `informer` events, like so:

```javascript
bus.emit('informer', message, type, duration);
```

and displays a message bubble for a certain amount of time. It will be useful to
notify you when the internet connection is (a licky boom-boom) down (or back
up):

<img alt="info: no connection" src="/img/blog/0.9/info-no-connection.jpg" className="border" />

Or when Uppy has successfully uploaded your files:

<img alt="info: upload successful" src="/img/blog/0.9/info-upload-success.jpg" className="border" />

## Webcam: Say Cheese!

The Webcam plugin can now take snapshots and add them to the file dashboard in
Uppy's modal. We have also added Flash support for Safari/IE users. The UI has
also been cleaned up in the dashboard. We have temporarily disabled video
recording in order to focus on rolling out the snapshot feature.

## Under the hood: UI refactors

Under the hood, we have made some changes to how the UI is structured. We are
taking a more componentized approach. For example, the rendering of Google
Drive's UI has been separated into multiple smaller components that can be found
in the `plugins/GoogleDrive` folder.
