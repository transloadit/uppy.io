Uppy 1.8, 1.9 and a few important security patches are out! Here are the
highlights:

<!--truncate-->

## Companion: security patches and new Instagram API

- We released a patch to an SSRF vulnerability affecting `@uppy/companion` and
  the `@uppy/url` plugin. Many thanks to the parties involved in
  [reporting and disclosing](https://hackerone.com/reports/786956) this
  vulnerability to the Uppy team. The patch is available in
  [@uppy/companion version 1.9.5](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#194).
- As the Instagram Legacy API will soon no longer be available, we have now
  added support for the new Instagram Graph API. As far as using this on
  `@uppy/companion` goes, not much has changed. The only difference is that you
  will now be retrieving your Instagram credentials from the
  [Facebook Developer Platform](https://developers.facebook.com/), and no longer
  from the [Instagram Developer Platform](https://www.instagram.com/developer/).

## Error handling

- We’ve significantly improved error handling and retries in `@uppy/core`,
  `@uppy/transloadit` and `@uppy/dashboard`. The retry button on the Status Bar,
  which was broken in some edge cases, now works as expected.
- Errors from Transloadit assemblies now include Assembly ID, as well as the
  full assembly object, for easier debugging.
- You can now click on the question mark (?) icon on the Informer or Dashboard
  error message, and get a browser alert with error details — much easier for
  the users to copy-paste the text this way. The Informer now also conveniently
  stays on screen, as long as you hover over the question mark.

## Dashboard

The Dashboard plugin has gained new file type icons: for images — useful before
the preview is generated, or when there’s no preview at all, like with images
from the Url plugin — and for archives.

## Types

Our typings got a significant upgrade: plugin options can now be type-checked!
In the past, we did have typings for plugin options, but the `uppy.use()`
function had a fallback that would accept _any_ object as options. If your
plugin options were wrong, typescript would just use the fallback and not tell
you about it!

Stricter typings normally mean that old code may no longer type-check. So,
although this is a bugfix, you have to opt into the new types. In 2.0, the old
way will be removed and only the strict types will be available.

You can opt in by specifying the `StrictTypes` type parameter to the `Uppy`
type:

```typescript
import Uppy = require('@uppy/core');
const uppy = Uppy<Uppy.StrictTypes>({
	// options here
});
```

This type parameter must also be specified if you are storing the `uppy`
instance anywhere. For example, inside a class:

```typescript
class UppyProvider extends React.Component {
	private uppy: Uppy<Uppy.StrictTypes>;
	constructor(props) {
		super(props);
		this.uppy = Uppy<Uppy.StrictTypes>({
			// etc
		});
	}
}
```

If you do not specify the `StrictTypes` parameter, the old fallback for the
`uppy.use()` method remains available.

The typings for `@uppy/react` component props are now derived from plugin
options types, so they will no longer get out of sync, as they occasionally did
in the past. For example, in version 1.7, the `@uppy/drag-drop` plugin supported
a `note` option to add some text to the drop area. The React typings didn't
include that option, so you couldn't use it from typescript! That is now
permanently fixed:

```typescript
import components = require('@uppy/react');
const { DragDrop } = components;

// assuming some `uppy` variable already exists
declare var uppy: Uppy<Uppy.StrictTypes>;

function MyComponent() {
	return <DragDrop uppy={uppy} note="This prop is now supported!" />;
}
```

Finally, the `locale` options and React props now have full typings. Your editor
should now be able to provide autocompletion for language keys!

We now also use `tsd`, so our typings are actually tested.

See [PR #1918](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1918) for all the
details.
