Uppy 1.25 adds support for right-to-left scripts, Ukrainian translation and
various improvements for Companion.

Just see how cool this looks, and read further for a video demo and some behind
the scenes implementation sorcery:

## Right-to-left scripts

Renée have improved support for right-to-left scripts (such as Arabic, Farsi,
Hebrew). This means that Uppy UI can now be mirrored, like how you might see on
sites like
[Wikipedia](https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A9).

HTML `dir` attribute can be used to set the direction — any parent element of
the Dashboard may have it. It’s good practice for sites to add a dir attribute
on `<html>` element, but for backwards compatibility the Dashboard will default
to left-to-right rendering.

The text direction can also be set in code using the new `direction` option for
the Dashboard plugin. This is useful for the modal dashboard, which would
typically be mounted in the `<body>` element, so there is no other parent
element that you could set the `dir` attribute on (aside from `<body>` and
`<html>`, which sites _should_ do, but may not).

> [#2705 PR description and code](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/2705),
> if you are interested in how this is implemented, using new CSS properties
> like `inline-start` and `inline-end` with `postcss-logical` and
> `postcss-dir-pseudo-class` for the fallback.

## Locales

[@DenysNosov](https://github.com/elkebab) contributed a Ukrainian translation
and fixes for Russian grammar!

## Integration Guide

Andrew, who’s been on fire recently adding Vue and Svelte integrations for Uppy,
has taken the time to share his experience and has written an “Adding a new
integration” guide, in case you’d like to help befriend Uppy with your favorite
framework or library.

## Companion

- Added support for setting 3rd party credentials in runtime
- Metadata is now passed to S3
- Support for `opts.companionCookiesRule` rule
- Delete tus error’s `originalRequest` field before propagating error
- Companion now uses multi-stage docker build

## Misc

- @uppy/dashboard: emit fileId on both file-edit-start and file-edit-complete
  events
- @uppy/box: added Box to Uppy CDN
