Hey everyone! It has been a while since we last shared some news about our
progress and we can't wait to let you know what’s up(py)!

In October, we have been working hard to get Uppy 0.11 ready for release. This
entailed, among other things, doing a write-up of our general architecture,
bringing in a friend to look at what we’ve been up to, experimenting with Redux,
and updating the Dashboard UI and website example.

Here's what we have been up to, in some more detail.

<!--truncate-->

## More research and experiments

- We wrote an
  [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/master/ARCHITECTURE.md)
  document, describing our architecture and APIs.
- Author of [Choo](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/choo), Yoshua Wuyts, was
  invited to take a look at the state of things in Uppy, and he came up with a
  proposal for some changes, which we’ll be considering in the coming releases.
- We also conducted a few Redux experiments on Uppy, in the process of which, no
  animals were hurt. :dog:

## Dashboard: example features, StatusBar and updated UI

**Dashboard example** [on our website](https://uppy.io/examples/dashboard/) now
features several options:

- switchting between “inline” and “modal dialog / popup” mode;
- toggling the `autoProceed` option that starts uploads automatically, without
  waiting for a click on the “upload” button;
- enabling/disabling acquire plugins, like Google Drive and Webcam.

**StatusBar** is a – you guessed it – bar that appears on the bottom of the
Dashboard and unifies progress with pause/resume buttons.

**Dashboard UI** has undergone minor improvements, such as: a new “drag files
here” icon and tagline. Furthermore, the text before “acquire” icons on the top
— Local Disk, Google Drive, Webcam — has been removed (it used to say “Import
files from:”). We also added new “remove file” icons. You know, small things,
big difference. :sunglasses:

## HTTPS

We have upgraded both [uppy.io](http://uppy.io/) and [tus.io](http://tus.io/) to
support HTTPS with Let’s Encrypt. This will ensure that webcam example now
works, secure uploads work, and – hopefully – that all will be well.

## And more

- We have renamed FormTag plugin to FileInput and made it pretty by default,
  with an added option to just show the default browser “choose file”.
- [Fixed a bug](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/126) with
  `autoProceed: true` duplicating uploads.
- Refactored Dashboard to only keep active acquire panel in DOM.
- Added PersistentState plugin that saves state to localStorage — which is
  useful for development.
- [Grand refactor of Uppy Server](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/131)
  with dynamic controllers.
- Webcam stream no longer flashes when state is updated.
