And another week bites the dust! With the weekend right around the corner, we're
busy getting as much as possible done before heading off for some well-deserved
rest & relaxation. Here is what we've been up to!

## New

- [Alex](https://github.com/nqst) is test driving Uppy('s accessibility) in many
  different browsers and already uncovered
  [many issues](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/created_by/nqst) in
  some naughty browsers. Hope we'll manage to fix all of them before April 25!

## In Progress

- [Artur](https://github.com/arturi) is working on preparing the changelog for
  Uppy v. 0.30.4 and releasing it as soon as possible. More news about the
  0.30.4 release can be found in the _Done_ section.

- Our React Native team (that's [Artur](https://github.com/arturi),
  [Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju), and
  [Kevin](https://github.com/kvz)) have been pairing again and determined there
  are only a few things left to do:

  - Add customFingerPrint & hashCode into Ife's tus-js-client branch, add tests,
    and get it into shape for [Marius](https://github.com/acconut) to review
  - UI tweaks (close button for Import, reporting errors)
  - File preview icon for non-image files

- They also discussed a few non-React Native things:

  - Large file support
  - Companion XHR Uploads should report download progress towards
    client-side-reported upload progress
  - When you upload to api2.transloadit.com with XHR, it seems the API does not
    block and responds with 200 before the upload is really done (MAYBE :o).
    This results in a bad Uppy state without a progress bar.

## Done

- We released a new version of Uppy. While it isn’t 1.0 just quite yet, this is
  another step in the right direction. Uppy `0.30.4` features fixes for
  `allowSyntheticImports`, Typescript typings, issues when using Companion
  Client for remote AWS-S3 uploads, and using websockets and console.dir in
  React Native.

- Artur and [Renée](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop) reviewed and merged a
  [PR](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1360) that allows a user to
  customize the status of an upload in Uppy. Thanks to Mactavish for
  contributing!

- [Abdel](https://github.com/kiloreux)
  [fixed the Serverless example](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1408)
  for running Companion on AWS Lambda.

- [Kevin](https://github.com/kvz) finished up his work on the
  [new documentation menu structure](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1405)
  that we talked about [yesterday](/blog/2019/04/liftoff-10/).

That’s it. All the updates I have for you today. Have a great
[weekend](/blog/2019/04/liftoff-12/) everyone! And if you don’t want to miss a
