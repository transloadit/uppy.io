Happy Easter everyone! :egg::rabbit: It's like a regular Sunday, but with a
cherry on top! Spring is also in the air, so we wish you all some nice weather
to enjoy with friends and family. Since we are also spending today egg hunting
rather than bug chasing, we'll keep it short. So, once more, from us â€” and this
lovely Roomba-riding pup:

We'll be back tomorrow on [Day 28](/blog/2019/04/liftoff-28/) with another small
easter egg from the Uppy team!
