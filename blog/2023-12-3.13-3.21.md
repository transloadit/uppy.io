It‚Äôs this time of the year again! Make yourself cozy
[by the fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouqtX6WWL1U), and let us help you
unwrap the gifts Uppy has prepared for you.

We proud of all the improvements and amazing new features and bug fixes we were
able to introduce this year. The highlights being: conditional S3 multipart and
signing S3 uploads on the client, speedy handling of 10-50k file uploads,
refresh tokens (useful when the token expires mid-upload for a large amount of
files / slow connections), server-sent events and new `assemblyOptions` for the
Transloadit plugin, Dashboard Single File mode (`singleFileFullScreen`),
improved ETA in the Status Bar, a bunch of new languages, including Hindi,
Mexican Spanish and Catalan.

This one, however, is a recent Uppy updates post, covering releases from
[`3.13.0` to `3.21.0`](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/compare/uppy%403.13.0...uppy%403.21.0):
announcing the switch to Typescript, Dashboard can now auto-install plugins,
support for Catalan language, a heap of bug fixes for Tus, Companion, AWS S3,
and more.

## Typescript

We are excited to announce that we are working hard to refactor Uppy Core and
all plugins source files to TypeScript. We have a build setup in place that
temporarily supports both `.ts` and `.js` files in our monorepo. And a helper
utility that takes a package name and does the initial renaming and Typescript
config. Then we go through the list of plugins one by one. We begun with
`@uppy/utils` and `@uppy/core`, since most other packages depend on those. Now
we are moving to the rest, one by one.

This work so far is only affecting Uppy internals. In published packages we are
using the manually crafted `d.ts` files, as before. We are planning to flip the
switch and introduce some breaking changes in the next Uppy major, due to be
released in the first quater of 2024.

## Core

- Allow duplicate files with `onBeforeFileAdded`.
- Fixed`onBeforeFileAdded` with Golden Retriever.
- Simplify types with class generic and type more events.

## Image Editor

We have a whole separate blog post about the recent rotation improvements in the
Image Editor, so please read that, if you are interested. Other changes include:

- Fixed labels on all buttons, centered the rotation slider label.
- Limited cropbox movements.
- Fixed to respect `cropperOptions.initialAspectRatio`.
- Change the checkered background color, make it semi-transparent.
- Fixed granular rotation: `[-45, 45]` instead of `[-45, 44]`.
- Removed 1px black lines.
- Made `file-editor:cancel` event fire when the Image Editor‚Äôs ‚Äúcancel‚Äù button
  is pressed.

## Dashboard

Dashboard can now automatically discover and install compatible plugins without
`target` option. This lets you use a much more condense syntax:

```js
const uppy = new Uppy()
	.use(ImageEditor)
	.use(Dashboard)
	.use(Webcam)
	.use(GoogleDrive);
```

:::tip

The old way via `.use(ImageEditor, { target: Dashboard })` and
`.use(Dashboard, { plugins: ['Webcam', 'GoogleDrive'] })` still works, but we
encourage you to use the new syntax.

:::

Bug fixes:

- Remove `.uppy-Dashboard-isFixed` CSS class when `uppy.close()` is invoked.
- When `showAddFilesPanel: true`, `aria-hidden` should be the opposite.
- Don‚Äôt cancel all files and Assemblies when clicking ‚Äúdone‚Äù.
- Update Dashboard‚Äôs blue color to meet WCAG contrast requirements.

## AWS S3

- Fixed `TypeError`, fixed `uploadURL` when using `PUT`.
- Pass `signal` as separate arg for backward compat; pass the `uploadURL` back
  to the caller.
- Refresh file before calling user-defined functions.
- Made sure we retry signature request.
- Use uppercase HTTP method names.
- Call `#setCompanionHeaders` in `setOptions`.

## Companion

One of the most notable changes in Companion is on the client side, we‚Äôve made
authentication optional, allowing for more provider types, with publicly
accessable links, for example.

In Companion Client we were able to drop the now unnecessary preflight requests,
improving upload speeds and latency yet again.

Other notable changes and fixes:

- Allow dynamic S3 bucket.
- Companion+client stability fixes, error handling and retries.
- Catch ‚Äúinvalid initialization vector‚Äù instead of crashing.
- Added Onedrive refresh tokens.
- Fixed `authProvider` property inconsistency.
- Fixed accelerated endpoints for presigned POST.
- Fixed double tus uploads.
- Fixed onedrive pagination.
- Fixed Redis key default TTL.
- Fixed Uploader.js metadata normalisation.
- Make CSRF protection helpers available to providers.
- Refactor `getProtectedHttpAgent` to make TS happy.
- Unify redis initialization.
- Use deferred length for tus streams.
- Fixed a refresh token race condition.
- Fixed edge case for pagination on root.
- Fixed instagram/facebook auth error regression; uploadRemoteFile undefined;
  ProviderView error on empty plugin.icon.
- Added getBucket metadata argument.
- Added missing credentialsURL for box.
- Added test endpoint for dynamic oauth creds.
- Added Companion OAuth Key type.
- Aliased ‚ÄúremoveListener‚Äù as ‚Äúoff‚Äù in Redis emitter.
- Use user-defined `onSuccess`, `onError`, and `onProgress` callbacks in
  `@uppy/tus`.
- Invoke headers function for remote uploads.
- Send certain Onedrive errors to the user.
- Upgraded Node.js docker version.

## Frameworks Integraions

- Angular: upgraded to Angular 16.x.
- Svelte: Fixed TS build command.
- Vue: added export for FileInput.

## Locales

- Added Catalan locale `ca_ES`.
- Added missing translations to `de_DE`.
- Update Farsi.

## Transloadit

- Emit assembly progress events.
- Removed Socket.io ‚Äî it‚Äôs server-sent events with fallback to polling now.

## Misc

- Added Prettier, migrated to Vitest for Uppy core and Uppy plugins.
- Update `file.meta.name` after compression, becase format/extension might have
  changed.
- use latest Node.js version for tests.
- Migrate to AWS-SDK V3 syntax.
- Move remote file upload logic into companion-client.

Happy holidays and see you in 2024!
