We’re always looking for opportunities to teach Uppy cool new tricks, and the
past few months have been no exception. Since our
[most recent post](https://uppy.io/blog/2021/12/2.1-2.3/) in December, Uppy has
continued to receive a steady stream of updates. This post covers all the
improvements made in Uppy versions 2.4 through 2.7. Changes and additions
include: image compression, improved Transloadit rate limiting and a lighter
Dashboard plugin. We’ve also moved our end-to-end tests to Cypress, and are
slowly converting plugins to ES modules (ESM).

## Compressor

Some of the most commonly uploaded files on the internet are images — photos,
stock images, screenshots, and documents scans. Uppy now includes a new plugin
called `@uppy/compressor` that optimizes images (JPEG, PNG), saving on average
up to 60% in size (roughly 18 MB for 10 images). It uses
[Compressor.js](https://github.com/fengyuanchen/compressorjs) under the hood.

[Read the docs](https://uppy.io/docs/compressor/) and
[try Compressor in action](https://uppy.io/examples/dashboard/).

```js
import Uppy from '@uppy/core';
import Compressor from '@uppy/compressor';

const uppy = new Uppy();
uppy.use(Compressor);
```

`@uppy/compressor` is also the first plugin that we are releasing as ESM,
backwards compatible as CJS, to test out how this works. Please report any
issues.

## Hosted Companion custom credentials

It cannot be overstated that our
[Transloadit-hosted](https://transloadit.com/docs/sdks/uppy/)
[Companion Plugin](https://uppy.io/docs/companion/) is the easiest secure way to
allow your users pick files from cloud sources like Google Drive, Instagram,
Box, etc. via Uppy. Up until now, however, that meant your users had to
authenticate their cloud account with Transloadit, preventing you from showing
your own logo instead. That has now been fixed! Head to `Transloadit Console` /
`Credentials`, scroll down to `Third-party Credentials`, click on
`Add new Credentials`, select `Companion OAuth`, and voilà!

[free Transloadit Community Plan — 5GB / month and access to Companion](https://transloadit.com/pricing/).

## Transloadit rate limiting

We’ve added rate limiting to Transloadit
[assembly creation and status polling](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/3429),
and [tus retries](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/3394):

> When the remote server responds with HTTP 429, all requests are paused for a
> while in the hope that it can resolve the rate limiting. Failed requests are
> now also queued up after the retry delay. Before, they were scheduled for
> retry without being queued up, which would sometimes end up overflowing the
> limit option.

As a result of this change, uploading many files at once has become even more
robust.

## Move to ESM

The JavaScript ecosystem is moving towards ESM, and we want to follow suit. We
are slowly starting to adopt ESM in Uppy packages. To do so, we integrated a
plugin into our build system that transpiles ESM source code to CommonJS syntax,
which is distributed with the npm package. Nothing will change on your end,
though – we know that not everyone is using tooling that support ESM, so we’re
holding on to CommonJS for the time being. Our plan is to refactor all official
Uppy plugins to ESM before Uppy 3.0 is released, and drop CommonJS in favor of
ESM in the npm packages at that point.

For details, see [PR 3468](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/3468).

## End to end: move to Cypress

Uppy has had end to end from the start, but the developer experience was less
than ideal with custom Webdriver.io + Selenium. The transition to
[Cypress](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/3444) allows us to write
tests with ease and comfort, backed by great documentation.

## Lighter Bundle

We continue to look for ways to reduce Uppy’s bundle size and modernize our
build toolchain. This time, we’ve replaced the
[Exifr.js](https://github.com/exif-js/exif-js) legacy bundle with the modern one
without IE polyfills. Our Browserify bundler has been replaced with a modern and
more efficient ESBuild.

## Companion improvements

- Improved private IP check (#3403)
- Implement periodic ping functionality (#3246)
- Fix broken thumbnails for Box and Dropbox (#3460)
- Fix unpslash author meta, sanitize metadata to strings and improve Companion
  tests (#3478)

That’s it for today! See the full
[changelog](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1300)
for more details.
