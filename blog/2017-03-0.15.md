Spring is in the air and Uppy is feeling particularly full of life. In this post
about Uppy 0.15, we have some exciting stories about `babel-plugin-yo-yoify`,
progress event throttling, and new friends.

## Yo-yoify for NPM-installed Uppy

In [`0.14`](https://uppy.io/blog/2017/02/0.14/), we added `yo-yoify` transform
to give Uppy some extra speed and eliminate `Function.caller` issues. As it
turned out, we [forgot](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/158) about
our Babel-transpiled `lib` version of Uppy that gets published to NPM üôÄ. We
then spent some time creating a standalone version of `yo-yoify` that would be
able to parse `yo-yo` template strings before Babel-transpilation, only to
discover that there already is a
[`babel-plugin-yo-yoify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-yo-yoify)
that not only does precisely that, but also frees us from jumping through a lot
of unnecessary hoops. It did
[have](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop/babel-plugin-yo-yoify/issues/9)
[a few](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop/babel-plugin-yo-yoify/pull/8)
[issues](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop/babel-plugin-yo-yoify/issues/11) at
first, but luckily our friend [Ren√©e](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop) was
available to colaborate with us on this. Ren√©e has also agreed to join Uppy for
a while to help us with other pressing issues. So, silver linings ‚Äî bugs can
sometimes lead to new friends and wonderful beginnings. We are very excited
about what this all means for Uppy in the months to come.

Uppy from NPM is now good to go and the issue has been completely resolved. You
can update at: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/uppy>. And yeah, if you use
`yo-yo`, give
[`babel-plugin-yo-yoify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-yo-yoify) a
try.

## Pause & Resume Remote Uploads

Just like with ‚Äúlocal‚Äù uploads, Uppy can now pause and resume remote uploads
from Google Drive or Dropbox (handled on the backend by `uppy-server` + `tus`).
üéâ

## Progress Throttling

While working on pausing remote uploads with `uppy-server`, Ife discovered a
strange bug: uppy-client would hang during the upload, after which the progress
would immediately jump to 100%. After some solid Sherlock Holmesing, we found
what was causing it: uploads were happening too fast. This was leading to
progress events being sent very, very often (like 300 / second), which trashed
the interface rendering loop. We have solved this by
[adding throttling in tus-js-client](https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/commit/9940f27b2361fd7e10ba58b09b60d82422183bbb)
(thanks Marius!) and
[uppy-server](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy-server/commit/936ad48e92631c45d123664900b9aabcf7a190fa)
(thanks Ife!). I would also very much like to take this opportunity to thank
myself for
[fixing](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/commit/1d5f4404546420442deabc94df84bd3ec0677eec)
[it](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/commit/db32c6f4fd85420532f27f04920dbaf6d126ea9b)
in uppy-client too! :innocent:

To prevent ‚Äújumping‚Äù progress, numbers and text in StatusBar are now only
updated once a second. Plus, we have switched to
[`prettier-bytes`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier-bytes), which adds
some nice number rounding. Smooth as butter!

TL;DR Uppy was simply too fast at uploading, so we had to shorten the leash a
bit!

## Informer coming at you in full-color mode

Informer will now be able to change the way it looks depending on the `type`
argument:

```js
// (`'informer'`, `text`, `type`, `duration`)
uppy.emit('informer', 'Connected!', 'success', 3000);
```

<img src="/img/blog/0.15/informer.png" />

This supports the following `type`s: `info`, `warning`, `error`, `success`, all
with their own colors!

## Some other things

- Multipart now treats all 2xx responses as successful and returns xhr object in
  `core:upload-success` event callback.
- That progress circle that you can see on each file in Dashboard has been
  improved on the inside: precise `circleLength` and
  `stroke-dasharray/stroke-dashoffset` calculation.
- Uppy-server returns uploaded file urls and sizes for remote uploads (from
  Google Drive & Dropbox).
- Provider plugins now have a loading screen, error screen and logout link.
  Breadcrumbs are also working again.

## Release Notes

Here is the full list of changes for version 0.15:

- build: update dependencies and eslint-plugin-standard, nodemon --> onchange,
  because simpler and better options (@arturi)
- build: fix `Function.caller` issue in `lib` which gets published to NPM
  package, add babel-plugin-yo-yoify (@arturi #158 #163)
- provider: show error view for things like not being able to connect to uppy
  server, should this be happening when uppy-server is unavailable
