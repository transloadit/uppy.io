# Quick start

Uppy is a sleek, modular JavaScript file uploader that integrates seamlessly
with any application. It‚Äôs fast, has a comprehensible API and lets you worry
about more important problems than building a file uploader.

- **Fetch** files from local disk, remote URLs, Google Drive, Dropbox, Box,
  Instagram or snap and record selfies with a¬†camera
- **Preview** and edit metadata with a nice interface
- **Upload** to the final destination, optionally process/encode

## Features

- Lightweight, modular plugin-based architecture, light on dependencies :zap:
- Resumable file uploads via the open [tus](https://tus.io/) standard, so large
  uploads survive network hiccups
- Supports picking files from: Webcam, Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, Instagram,
  bypassing the user‚Äôs device where possible, syncing between servers directly
  via [@uppy/companion](/docs/companion)
- Works great with file encoding and processing backends, such as
  [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com), works great without (all you need is
  to roll your own Apache/Nginx/Node/FFmpeg/etc backend)
- Sleek user interface :sparkles:
- Optional file recovery (after a browser crash) with
  [Golden Retriever](/docs/golden-retriever/)
- Speaks several languages (i18n) :earth_africa:
- Built with accessibility in mind
- Free for the world, forever (as in beer üç∫, pizza üçï, and liberty üóΩ)
- Cute as a puppy, also accepts cat pictures :dog:
