# Quick start

Uppy is a sleek, modular JavaScript file uploader that integrates seamlessly
with any application. Itâ€™s fast, has a comprehensible API and lets you worry
about more important problems than building a file uploader.

:::tip

You can take Uppy for a walk inside CodeSandbox with a
[minimal drag & drop](https://codesandbox.io/s/uppy-drag-drop-gyewzx?file=/src/index.js)
experience or a
[full featured dashboard](https://codesandbox.io/s/uppy-dashboard-xpxuhd).
