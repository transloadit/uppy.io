# Quick start

Uppy is an uploader and (optionally) an user interface, tied together by the [core library][core],
with lots of plugins to gradually add more functionality.

In this quick start we will build a small yet powerful example with [@uppy/dashboard][] and [@uppy/tus][].

:::tip
You can take Uppy for a walk with the **[Stackblitz](#)** or **[CodeSandbox](#)** examples.
Both examples can also be cloned with Git for a kickstart locally.
:::

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM" default>

  ```shell
  npm install @uppy/core @uppy/dashboard @uppy/tus
  ```

  <QuickStartBoilerPlate />
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

  ```shell
  yarn add @uppy/core @uppy/dashboard @uppy/tus
  ```

  <QuickStartBoilerPlate />
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="cdn" label="CDN">
    <UppyCdnExample>
      {`
        var uppy = new Uppy.Core()
        uppy.use(Uppy.DragDrop, { target: '#uppy' })
        uppy.use(Uppy.Tus, { endpoint: '//tusd.tusdemo.net/files/' })
      `}
    </UppyCdnExample>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Next steps

That’s it! You tried Uppy for the first time.
This was a taste of what Uppy can do, its power comes from modularity and versatility.

Here are some interesting things:

*   [Choosing the upload strategy you need](/docs/guides/choosing-upload-strategy).
*   With [Companion](/docs/companion) your users will be able to select files from remote sources, such as Instagram,
    Google Drive and Dropbox. It bypasses the client (so a 5 GB video isn’t eating into your users’ data plans)
    and uploads to your preferred final destination.
*   Recover files from accidental refreshes or closed tabs with [Golden Retriever](/docs/golden-retriever).
*   Add [image editing](/docs/user-interfaces/elements/image-editor) to [Dashboard][@uppy/dashboard].
