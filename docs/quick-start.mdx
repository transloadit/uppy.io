# Quick start

Uppy is a sleek, modular JavaScript file uploader that integrates seamlessly
with any application. It’s fast, has a comprehensible API and lets you worry
about more important problems than building a file uploader.

:::tip

You can take Uppy for a walk inside StackBlitz with a
[minimal drag & drop](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-yzbujq?file=main.js/g)
experience or a
[full featured dashboard](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-zaqyaf?file=main.js).
