# Dashboard

The all you need Dashboard — powerful, responsive, and pluggable. Kickstart your
uploading experience and gradually add more functionality. Add files from
[remote sources](/docs/companion), [edit images](/docs/image-editor),
[generate thumbnails](/docs/thumbnail-generator), and more.

Checkout [integrations](#integrations) for the full list of plugins you can
integrate.

## When should I use this?

There could be many reasons why you may want to use the Dashboard, but some
could be:

- when you need a battle tested plug-and-play uploading UI to save time.
- when your users need to add files from [remote sources](/docs/companion), such
  [Google Drive](/docs/google-drive), [Dropbox](/docs/dropbox), and others.
- when you need to collect [meta data](#metafields) from your users per file.
- when your users want to take a picture with their [webcam](/docs/webcam) or
  [capture their screen](/docs/screen-capture).

## Install

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM" default>

```shell
npm install @uppy/core @uppy/dashboard
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```shell
yarn add @uppy/core @uppy/dashboard
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="cdn" label="CDN">
    <UppyCdnExample>
      {`
        import { Uppy, Dashboard } from "{{UPPY_JS_URL}}"
        const uppy = new Uppy()
        uppy.use(Dashboard, { target: '#uppy', inline: true })
      `}
    </UppyCdnExample>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Use

```js showLineNumbers
import Uppy from '@uppy/core';
import Dashboard from '@uppy/dashboard';

import '@uppy/core/dist/style.min.css';
import '@uppy/dashboard/dist/style.min.css';

new Uppy().use(Dashboard, { inline: true, target: '#uppy-dashboard' });
```

:::note

The `@uppy/dashboard` plugin includes CSS for the Dashboard itself, and the
various plugins used by the Dashboard, such as
([`@uppy/status-bar`](/docs/status-bar) and [`@uppy/informer`](/docs/informer)).
If you also use the `@uppy/status-bar` or `@uppy/informer` plugin directly, you
should not include their CSS files, but instead only use the one from the
`@uppy/dashboard` plugin.

:::

:::note

Styles for Provider plugins, like Google Drive and Instagram, are also bundled
with Dashboard styles. Styles for other plugins, such as `@uppy/url` and
`@uppy/webcam`, are not included. If you are using those, please see their docs
and make sure to include styles for them as well.

## API

### Options

#### `id`

A unique identifier for this plugin (`string`, default: `'Dashboard'`).

Plugins that are added by the Dashboard get unique IDs based on this ID, like
`'Dashboard:StatusBar'` and `'Dashboard:Informer'`.

#### `target`

Where to render the Dashboard (`string` or `Element`, default: `'body'`).

You can pass an element, class, or id as a string. Dashboard is rendered into
`body`, because it’s hidden by default and only opened as a modal when `trigger`
is clicked.

#### `inline`

Render the Dashboard as a modal or inline (`boolean`, default: `false`).

When `false`, Dashboard is opened by clicking on [`trigger`](#trigger). If
`inline: true`, Dashboard will be rendered into [`target`](#target) and fit
right in.

#### `trigger`

A CSS selector for a button that will trigger opening the Dashboard modal
(`string`, default: `null`).

Several buttons or links can be used, as long as they are selected using the
same selector (`.select-file-button`, for example).

#### `width`

Width of the Dashboard in pixels (`number`, default: `750`). Used when
`inline: true`.

#### `height`

Height of the Dashboard in pixels (`number`, default: `550`). Used when
`inline: true`.

#### `waitForThumbnailsBeforeUpload`

Whether to wait for all thumbnails from `@uppy/thumbnail-generator` to be ready
before starting the upload (`boolean`, default `false`).

If set to `true`, Thumbnail Generator will envoke Uppy’s internal processing
stage, displaying “Generating thumbnails...” message, and wait for
`thumbnail:all-generated` event, before proceeding to the uploading stage.

This is useful because Thumbnail Generator also adds EXIF data to images, and if
we wait until it’s done processing, this data will be available on the server
after the upload.

#### `showLinkToFileUploadResult`

Turn the file icon and thumbnail in the Dashboard into a link to the uploaded
file (`boolean`, default: `false`).

Please make sure to return the `url` key (or the one set via
`responseUrlFieldName`) from your server.

#### `showProgressDetails`

Show or hide progress details in the status bar (`boolean`, default: `false`).

By default, progress in Status Bar is shown as a percentage. If you would like
to also display remaining upload size and time, set this to `true`.

`showProgressDetails: false`: Uploading: 45%

`showProgressDetails: true`: Uploading: 45%・43 MB of 101 MB・8s left

#### `hideUploadButton`

Show or hide the upload button (`boolean`, default: `false`).

Use this if you are providing a custom upload button somewhere, and are using
the `uppy.upload()` API.

#### `hideRetryButton`

Hide the retry button in the status bar and on each individual file (`boolean`,
default: `false`).

Use this if you are providing a custom retry button somewhere and if you are
using the `uppy.retryAll()` or `uppy.retryUpload(fileID)` API.

#### `hidePauseResumeButton`

Hide the pause/resume button (for resumable uploads, via [tus](http://tus.io),
for example) in the status bar and on each individual file (`boolean`, default:
`false`).

Use this if you are providing custom cancel or pause/resume buttons somewhere,
and using the `uppy.pauseResume(fileID)` or `uppy.removeFile(fileID)` API.

#### `hideCancelButton`

Hide the cancel button in status bar and on each individual file (`boolean`,
default: `false`).

Use this if you are providing a custom retry button somewhere, and using the
`uppy.cancelAll()` API.

#### `hideProgressAfterFinish`

Hide the status bar after the upload has finished (`boolean`, default: `false`).

#### `doneButtonHandler`

This option is passed to the status bar and will render a “Done” button in place
of pause/resume/cancel buttons, once the upload/encoding is done. The behaviour
of this “Done” button is defined by this handler function, for instance to close
the file picker modals or clear the upload state.

This is what the Dashboard sets by default:

```js
const doneButtonHandler = () => {
	this.uppy.cancelAll();
	this.requestCloseModal();
};
```

Set to `null` to disable the “Done” button.

#### `showSelectedFiles`

Show the list of added files with a preview and file information (`boolean`,
default: `true`).

In case you are showing selected files in your own app’s UI and want the Uppy
Dashboard to only be a picker, the list can be hidden with this option.

See also [`disableStatusBar`](#disablestatusbar) option, which can hide the
progress and upload button.

#### `showRemoveButtonAfterComplete`

Show the remove button on every file after a successful upload (`boolean`,
default: `false`).

Enabling this option only shows the remove `X` button in the Dashboard UI, but
to actually send a request you should listen to
[`file-removed`](https://uppy.io/docs/uppy/#file-removed) event and add your
logic there.

Example:

```js
uppy.on('file-removed', (file, reason) => {
	if (reason === 'removed-by-user') {
		sendDeleteRequestForFile(file);
	}
});
```

For an implementation example, please see
[#2301](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/2301#issue-628931176).

#### `singleFileFullScreen`

When only one file is selected, its preview and meta information will be
centered and enlarged (`boolean`, default: `true`).

Often times Uppy used for photo / profile image uploads, or maybe a single
document. Then it makes sense to occupy the whole space of the available
Dashboard UI, giving the stage to this one file. This feature is automatically
disabled when Dashboard is small in height, since there’s not enough room.

#### `note`

A string of text to be placed in the Dashboard UI (`string`, default: `null`).

This could for instance be used to explain any [`restrictions`](#restrictions)
that are put in place. For example:
`'Images and video only, 2–3 files, up to 1 MB'`.

#### `metaFields`

Create text or custom input fields for the user to fill in (`Array<Object>` or
`Function`, default: `null`).

This will be shown when a user clicks the “edit” button on that file.

:::note

The meta data will only be set on a file object if it’s entered by the user. If
the user doesn’t edit a file’s metadata, it will not have default values;
instead everything will be `undefined`. If you want to set a certain meta field
to each file regardless of user actions, set
[`meta` in the Uppy constructor options](/docs/uppy/#meta).

:::

Each object can contain:

- `id`. The name of the meta field. This will also be used in CSS/HTML as part
  of the `id` attribute, so it’s better to
  [avoid using characters like periods, semicolons, etc](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79022).
- `name`. The label shown in the interface.
- `placeholder`. The text shown when no value is set in the field. (Not needed
  when a custom render function is provided)
- `render: ({value, onChange, required, form}, h) => void` (optional). A
  function for rendering a custom form element.
  - `value` is the current value of the meta field
  - `onChange: (newVal) => void` is a function saving the new value and `h` is
    the `createElement` function from
    [Preact](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/api-reference#h--createelement).
  - `required` is a boolean that’s true if the field `id` is in the
    `restrictedMetaFields` restriction
  - `form` is the `id` of the associated `<form>` element.
  - `h` can be useful when using Uppy from plain JavaScript, where you cannot
    write JSX.

<details>
<summary>Example: meta fields configured as an `Array`</summary>

```js
uppy.use(Dashboard, {
	trigger: '#pick-files',
	metaFields: [
		{ id: 'name', name: 'Name', placeholder: 'file name' },
		{ id: 'license', name: 'License', placeholder: 'specify license' },
		{
			id: 'caption',
			name: 'Caption',
			placeholder: 'describe what the image is about',
		},
		{
			id: 'public',
			name: 'Public',
			render({ value, onChange, required, form }, h) {
				return h('input', {
					type: 'checkbox',
					required,
					form,
					onChange: (ev) => onChange(ev.target.checked ? 'on' : ''),
					defaultChecked: value === 'on',
				});
			},
		},
	],
});
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Example: dynamic meta fields based on file type with a `Function`</summary>

```js
uppy.use(Dashboard, {
	trigger: '#pick-files',
	metaFields: (file) => {
		const fields = [{ id: 'name', name: 'File name' }];
		if (file.type.startsWith('image/')) {
			fields.push({ id: 'location', name: 'Photo Location' });
			fields.push({ id: 'alt', name: 'Alt text' });
			fields.push({
				id: 'public',
				name: 'Public',
				render: ({ value, onChange, required, form }, h) => {
					return h('input', {
						type: 'checkbox',
						onChange: (ev) => onChange(ev.target.checked ? 'on' : ''),
						defaultChecked: value === 'on',
						required,
						form,
					});
				},
			});
		}
		return fields;
	},
});
```

</details>

#### `closeModalOnClickOutside`

Set to true to automatically close the modal when the user clicks outside of it
(`boolean`, default: `false`).

#### `closeAfterFinish`

Set to true to automatically close the modal when all current uploads are
complete (`boolean`, default: `false`).

With this option, the modal is only automatically closed when uploads are
complete _and successful_. If some uploads failed, the modal stays open so the
user can retry failed uploads or cancel the current batch and upload an entirely
different set of files instead.

:::info

You can use this together with the
[`allowMultipleUploads: false`](/docs/uppy/#allowmultipleuploads) option in Uppy
Core to create a smooth experience when uploading a single (batch of) file(s).

This is recommended. With several upload batches, the auto-closing behavior can
be quite confusing for users.

:::

#### `disablePageScrollWhenModalOpen`

Disable page scroll when the modal is open (`boolean`, default: `true`).

Page scrolling is disabled by default when the Dashboard modal is open, so when
you scroll a list of files in Uppy, the website in the background stays still.
Set to false to override this behaviour and leave page scrolling intact.

#### `animateOpenClose`

Add animations when the modal dialog is opened or closed, for a more satisfying
user experience (`boolean`, default: `true`).

#### `fileManagerSelectionType`

Configure the type of selections allowed when browsing your file system via the
file manager selection window (`string`, default: `'files'`).

May be either `'files'`, `'folders'`, or `'both'`. Selecting entire folders for
upload may not be supported on all
[browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=input-file-directory).

#### `proudlyDisplayPoweredByUppy`

Show the Uppy logo with a link (`boolean`, default: `true`).

Uppy is provided to the world for free by the team behind
[Transloadit](https://transloadit.com). In return, we ask that you consider
keeping a tiny Uppy logo at the bottom of the Dashboard, so that more people can
discover and use Uppy.

#### `disableStatusBar`

Disable the status bar completely (`boolean`, default: `false`).

Dashboard ships with the `StatusBar` plugin that shows upload progress and
pause/resume/cancel buttons. If you want, you can disable the StatusBar to
provide your own custom solution.

#### `disableInformer`

Disable informer (shows notifications in the form of toasts) completely
(`boolean`, default: `false`).

Dashboard ships with the `Informer` plugin that notifies when the browser is
offline, or when it’s time to say cheese if `Webcam` is taking a picture. If you
want, you can disable the Informer and/or provide your own custom solution.

#### `disableThumbnailGenerator`

Disable the thumbnail generator completely (`boolean`, default: `false`).

Dashboard ships with the `ThumbnailGenerator` plugin that adds small resized
image thumbnails to images, for preview purposes only. If you want, you can
disable the `ThumbnailGenerator` and/or provide your own custom solution.

#### `locale`

```js
module.exports = {
	strings: {
		// When `inline: false`, used as the screen reader label for the button that closes the modal.
		closeModal: 'Close Modal',
		// Used as the screen reader label for the plus (+) button that shows the “Add more files” screen

	},
};
```

#### `theme`

Light or dark theme for the Dashboard (`string`, default: `'light'`).

Uppy Dashboard supports “Dark Mode”. You can try it live on
[the Dashboard example page](https://uppy.io/examples/).

It supports the following values:

- `light` — the default
- `dark`
- `auto` — will respect the user’s system settings and switch automatically

#### `autoOpen`

Automatically open file editor for the file user just dropped/selected.  
If one file is added, editor opens for that file; if 10 files are added, editor
opens only for the first file.

This option supports the following values:

- `null` - the default
- `"metaEditor"` - open the meta fields editor if
  [meta fields](/docs/dashboard/#metafields) are enabled.
- `"imageEditor"` - open [`@uppy/image-editor`](/docs/image-editor) if the
  plugin is enabled.

#### `disabled`

Enabling this option makes the Dashboard grayed-out and non-interactive
(`boolean`, default: `false`).

Users won’t be able to click on buttons or drop files. Useful when you need to
conditionally enable/disable file uploading or manipulation, based on a
condition in your app. Can be set on init or via API:

```js
const dashboard = uppy.getPlugin('Dashboard');
dashboard.setOptions({ disabled: true });

userNameInput.addEventListener('change', () => {
	dashboard.setOptions({ disabled: false });
});
```

#### `disableLocalFiles`

Disable local files (`boolean`, default: `false`).

Enabling this option will disable drag & drop, hide the “browse” and “My Device”
button, allowing only uploads from plugins, such as Webcam, Screen Capture,
Google Drive, Instagram.

#### `onDragOver(event)`

Callback for the [`ondragover`][ondragover] event handler.

#### `onDrop(event)`

Callback for the [`ondrop`][ondrop] event handler.

#### `onDragLeave(event)`

Callback for the [`ondragleave`][ondragleave] event handler.
