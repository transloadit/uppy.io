# Svelte

Uppy provides [Svelte][] components for the included UI plugins.

## Installation

All Svelte components are provided through the `@uppy/svelte` package.

Install from NPM:

```shell
npm install @uppy/svelte
# Or with yarn
yarn add @uppy/svelte
```

## CSS

Make sure to also include the necessary CSS files for each Uppy Svelte component
you are using.

For
[the example](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/tree/main/examples/svelte-example),
we used `svelte-preprocess` and `postcss` to allow imports in CSS. Here is a
basic guide for getting that configured with Rollup.

```shell
npm install -D postcss postcss-import postcss-load-config
# Or with yarn
yarn add -D postcss postcss-import postcss-load-config
```

Then create a `postcss.config.js` like so:

```js
import postcss from 'postcss-import';

export default {
	plugins: [postcss],
};
```

Finally, enable `postcss` in your `rollup.config.js`

```js
import preprocess from 'svelte-preprocess';
// ...
svelte({
	preprocess: preprocess({
		postcss: true,
	}),
});
// ...
```

## Usage

The components can be used with [Svelte][] and frameworks that are based off it,
like [Sapper][].

Instead of adding a UI plugin to an Uppy instance with `.use()`, the Uppy
instance can be passed into components as an `uppy` prop.

```html
<main><Dashboard uppy={uppy} plugins={["Webcam"]} /></main>

<script>
	import { Dashboard } from '@uppy/svelte';

	import Uppy from '@uppy/core';
	import Webcam from '@uppy/webcam';

	const uppy = new Uppy().use(Webcam);
</script>
```

The following plugins are available as Svelte component wrappers (you need to
install each package separately):

- `<Dashboard />` - renders an inline [`@uppy/dashboard`][].
- `<DashboardModal />` - renders a [`@uppy/dashboard`][] modal.
- `<DragDrop />` - renders a [`@uppy/drag-drop`][] area.
- `<ProgressBar />` - renders a [`@uppy/progress-bar`][].
- `<StatusBar />` - renders a [`@uppy/status-bar`][].

Each component takes a `props` prop that will be passed to the UI Plugin. Both
`@uppy/dashboard` based plugins also take a `plugins` array as a props, make it
easier to add your plugins.

### Initializing Uppy

Due to the way Svelte handles reactivity, you can initialize Uppy the same way
you would with vanilla JavaScript

```js
import Uppy from '@uppy/core';
import Webcam from '@uppy/webcam';

const uppy = new Uppy().use(Webcam);
```

## Components

### `<Dashboard />`

#### CSS

The `Dashboard` component requires the following CSS for styling:

```html
<style global>
	@import '@uppy/core/dist/style.css';
	@import '@uppy/dashboard/dist/style.css';
</style>
```

Import general Core styles from `@uppy/core/dist/style.css` first, then add the
Dashboard styles from `@uppy/dashboard/dist/style.css`. A minified version is
also available as `style.min.css` at the same path. The way to do import depends
on your build system.

⚠️ The `@uppy/dashboard` plugin includes CSS for the Dashboard itself, and the
various plugins used by the Dashboard, such as
([`@uppy/status-bar`](/docs/status-bar) and [`@uppy/informer`](/docs/informer)).
If you also use the `@uppy/status-bar` or `@uppy/informer` plugin directly, you
should not include their CSS files, but instead only use the one from the
`@uppy/dashboard` plugin.

Styles for Provider plugins, like Google Drive and Instagram, are also bundled
with Dashboard styles. Styles for other plugins, such as `@uppy/url` and
`@uppy/webcam`, are not included. If you are using those, please see their docs
and make sure to include styles for them as well.

#### Props

The `<Dashboard />` component supports all `@uppy/dashboard` options to be
passed as an object to the `props` prop:

```html
<Dashboard uppy={uppy} props={{ height: 350, plugins: ['Webcam'] }} />
```

The `<Dashboard />` cannot be passed to a `target:` option of a remote provider
or plugins such as [`@uppy/webcam`][]. To use other plugins like
[`@uppy/webcam`][] with the `<Dashboard />` component, first add them to the
Uppy instance, and then specify their `id` in the
[`plugins`](/docs/dashboard/#plugins) prop:

### `<DashboardModal />`

#### CSS

The `DashboardModal` component requires the following CSS for styling:

```html
<style global>
	@import '@uppy/core/dist/style.css';
	@import '@uppy/dashboard/dist/style.css';
</style>
```

Import general Core styles from `@uppy/core/dist/style.css` first, then add the
Dashboard styles from `@uppy/dashboard/dist/style.css`. A minified version is
also available as `style.min.css` at the same path. The way to do import depends
on your build system.

⚠️ The `@uppy/dashboard` plugin includes CSS for the Dashboard itself, and the
various plugins used by the Dashboard, such as
([`@uppy/status-bar`](/docs/status-bar) and [`@uppy/informer`](/docs/informer)).
If you also use the `@uppy/status-bar` or `@uppy/informer` plugin directly, you
should not include their CSS files, but instead only use the one from the
`@uppy/dashboard` plugin.

Styles for Provider plugins, like Google Drive and Instagram, are also bundled
with Dashboard styles. Styles for other plugins, such as `@uppy/url` and
`@uppy/webcam`, are not included. If you are using those, please see their docs
and make sure to include styles for them as well.

#### Props

The `<DashboardModal />` component supports all `@uppy/dashboard` options to be
passed as an object on the `props` prop. An Uppy instance must be provided in
the `uppy={}` prop.

The `<DashboardModal />` cannot be passed to a `target:` option of a remote
provider or plugins such as \[`@uppy/webcam`]\[@uppy/webcam]. To use other
plugins like \[`@uppy/webcam`]\[@uppy/webcam] with the `<DashboardModal />`
component, first add them to the Uppy instance, and then specify their `id` in
the [`plugins`](/docs/dashboard/#plugins) prop:

### `<DragDrop />`

#### CSS

The `DragDrop` component includes some basic styles, like shown in the
[example](/examples/dragdrop). You can also choose not to use it and provide
your own styles instead:

```html
<style global>
	@import '@uppy/core/dist/style.css';
	@import '@uppy/drag-drop/dist/style.css';
</style>
```

Import general Core styles from `@uppy/core/dist/style.css` first, then add the
Drag & Drop styles from `@uppy/drag-drop/dist/style.css`. A minified version is
also available as `style.min.css` at the same path. The way to do import depends
on your build system.js

#### Props

The `<DragDrop />` component supports all `@uppy/drag-drop` options to be passed
as an object on the `props` prop. An Uppy instance must be provided in the
`uppy={}` prop.

The `ProgressBar` plugin requires the following CSS for styling:

```html
<style global>
	@import '@uppy/core/dist/style.css';
	@import '@uppy/progress-bar/dist/style.css';
</style>
```

Import general Core styles from `@uppy/core/dist/style.css` first, then add the
