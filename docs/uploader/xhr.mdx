# XHR

The `@uppy/xhr-upload` plugin is for regular uploads to a HTTP server.

## When should I use it?

:::tip

Not sure which uploader is best for you? Read
“[Choosing the uploader you need](/docs/guides/choosing-uploader)”.

:::

When you have an existing HTTP server and you don’t need Transloadit services or
want to run a [tus][] server. Note that it’s still possible to use [tus][]
without running an extra server by integrating tus into your existing one. For
instance, if you have a Node.js server (or server-side framework like Next.js)
you could integrate [tus-node-server][].

## Install

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM" default>

```shell
npm install @uppy/xhr-upload
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```shell
yarn add @uppy/xhr-upload
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="cdn" label="CDN">
    <UppyCdnExample>
      {`
        import { Uppy, XHRUpload } from "{{UPPY_JS_URL}}"
        new Uppy().use(XHRUpload, { endpoint: 'https://tusd.tusdemo.net/files' })
      `}
    </UppyCdnExample>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Use

A quick overview of the complete API.

```js {10} showLineNumbers
import Uppy from '@uppy/core';
import Dashboard from '@uppy/dashboard';
import XHR from '@uppy/xhr-upload';

import '@uppy/core/dist/style.min.css';
import '@uppy/dashboard/dist/style.min.css';

new Uppy()
	.use(Dashboard, { inline: true, target: 'body' })
	.use(XHR, { endpoint: 'https://your-domain.com/upload' });
```

## API

### Options

#### `id`

A unique identifier for this plugin (`string`, default: `'XHRUpload'`).

#### `endpoint`

URL of the HTTP server (`string`, default: `null`).

#### `method`

Configures which HTTP method to use for the upload (`string`, default:
`'post'`).

#### `formData`

Configures whether to use a multipart form upload, using [FormData][]
(`boolean`, default: `true`).

This works similarly to using a `<form>` element with an `<input type="file">`
for uploads. When set to `true`, file metadata is also sent to the endpoint as
separate form fields. When set to `false`, only the file contents are sent.

#### `fieldName`

When [`formData`](#formData-true) is set to true, this is used as the form field
name for the file to be uploaded.

It defaults to `'files[]'` if `bundle` option is set to `true`, otherwise it
defaults to `'file'`.

#### `allowedMetaFields`

Pass an array of field names to limit the metadata fields that will be added to
upload.

- Set this to an empty array `[]` to not send any fields.
- Set this to `['name']` to only send the `name` field.
- Set this to `null` (the default) to send _all_ metadata fields.

If the [`formData`](#formData-true) option is set to false, `metaFields` is
ignored.

#### `headers`

An object containing HTTP headers to use for the upload request. Keys are header
names, values are header values.

```js
const headers = {
	authorization: `Bearer ${window.getCurrentUserToken()}`,
};
```

Header values can also be derived from file data by providing a function. The
function receives an [Uppy file][] and must return an object where the keys are
header names, and values are header values.

```js
const headers = (file) => {
	return {
		authorization: `Bearer ${window.getCurrentUserToken()}`,
		expires: file.meta.expires,
	};
};
```

:::note

The function syntax is not available when [`bundle`](#bundle) is set to `true`.

:::

#### `bundle`

Send all files in a single multipart request (`boolean`, default: `false`).

All files will be appended to the provided `fieldName` field in the request.

:::caution

When `bundle` is set to `true`:

- [`formData`](#formData-true) must also be set to `true`.
- Uppy won’t be able to bundle remote files (such as Google Drive) and will
  throw an error in this case.
- Only [global uppy metadata](/docs/uppy/#meta) is sent to the endpoint.
  Individual per-file metadata is ignored.

:::

To upload files on different fields, use
[`uppy.setFileState()`](/docs/uppy#uppy-setFileState-fileID-state) to set the
`xhrUpload.fieldName` property on the file:

```js
uppy.setFileState(fileID, {
	xhrUpload: { fieldName: 'pic0' },
});
```

#### `validateStatus`

Check if the response was successful (`function`, default:
`(status, responseText, response) => boolean`).

- By default, responses with a 2xx HTTP status code are considered successful.
- When `true`, [`getResponseData()`](#getResponseData-responseText-response)
  will be called and the upload will be marked as successful.
- When `false`, both
  [`getResponseData()`](#getResponseData-responseText-response) and
  [`getResponseError()`](#getResponseError-responseText-response) will be called
  and the upload will be marked as unsuccessful.

##### Parameters

- The `statusCode` is the numeric HTTP status code returned by the endpoint.
- The `responseText` is the XHR endpoint response as a string.
- `response` is the [XMLHttpRequest][] object.

:::note

This option is only used for **local** uploads. Uploads from remote providers
like Google Drive or Instagram do not support this and will always use the
default.

:::

#### `getResponseData`

Extract the response data from the successful upload (`function`, default:
`(responseText, response) => void`).

- `responseText` is the XHR endpoint response as a string.
- `response` is the [XMLHttpRequest][] object.

JSON is handled automatically, so you should only use this if the endpoint
responds with a different format. For example, an endpoint that responds with an
XML document:

```js
function getResponseData(responseText, response) {
	const parser = new DOMParser();
	const xmlDoc = parser.parseFromString(responseText, 'text/xml');
	return {
		url: xmlDoc.querySelector('Location').textContent,
	};
}
```

:::note

This response data will be available on the file’s `.response` property and will
be emitted in the [`upload-success`][uppy.upload-success] event.

:::

:::note

When uploading files from remote providers such as Dropbox or Instagram,
Companion sends upload response data to the client. This is made available in
the `getResponseData()` function as well. The `response` object from Companion
has some properties named after their [XMLHttpRequest][] counterparts.

:::

#### `getResponseError`

Extract the error from the failed upload (`function`, default:
`(responseText, response) => void`).

For example, if the endpoint responds with a JSON object containing a
`{ message }` property, this would show that message to the user:

```js
function getResponseError(responseText, response) {
	return new Error(JSON.parse(responseText).message);
}
```

#### `responseUrlFieldName`

The field name containing the location of the uploaded file (`string`, default:
`'url'`).

This is returned by [`getResponseData()`](#getResponseData).

#### `timeout: 30 * 1000`

Abort the connection if no upload progress events have been received for this
milliseconds amount (`number`, default: `30_000`).

Note that unlike the [`XMLHttpRequest.timeout`][xhr.timeout] property, this is a
timer between progress events: the total upload can take longer than this value.
Set to `0` to disable this check.

#### `limit`

The maximum amount of files to upload in parallel (`number`, default: `5`).

#### `responseType`

The response type expected from the server, determining how the `xhr.response`
property should be filled (`string`, default: `'text'`).

The `xhr.response` property can be accessed in a custom
[`getResponseData()`](#getResponseData-responseText-response) callback. This
option sets the [`XMLHttpRequest.responseType`][xhr.responsetype] property. Only
`''`, `'text'`, `'arraybuffer'`, `'blob'` and `'document'` are widely supported
by browsers, so it’s recommended to use one of those.

#### `withCredentials`

Indicates whether cross-site Access-Control requests should be made using
credentials (`boolean`, default: `false`).

#### `locale: {}`

```js
export default {
	strings: {
		// Shown in the Informer if an upload is being canceled because it stalled for too long.
		timedOut: 'Upload stalled for %{seconds} seconds, aborting.',
	},
};
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How to send along meta data with the upload?

When using XHRUpload with [`formData: true`](#formData-true), file metadata is
sent along with each upload request. You can set metadata for a file using
[`uppy.setFileMeta(fileID, data)`](/docs/uppy#uppy-setFileMeta-fileID-data), or
for all files simultaneously using
[`uppy.setMeta(data)`](/docs/uppy#uppy-setMeta-data).

It may be useful to set metadata depending on some file properties, such as the
size. You can use the [`file-added`](/docs/uppy/#file-added) event and the
[`uppy.setFileMeta(fileID, data)`](/docs/uppy#uppy-setFileMeta-fileID-data)
method to do this:

```js
uppy.on('file-added', (file) => {
	uppy.setFileMeta(file.id, {
		size: file.size,
	});
});
```

Now, a form field named `size` will be sent along to the
[`endpoint`](#endpoint-39-39) once the upload starts.

By default, all metadata is sent, including Uppy’s default `name` and `type`
metadata. If you do not want the `name` and `type` metadata properties to be
sent to your upload endpoint, you can use the [`metaFields`](#metaFields-null)
option to restrict the field names that should be sent.

```js
uppy.use(XHRUpload, {
	// Only send our own `size` metadata field.
	allowedMetaFields: ['size'],
});
```

### How to upload to a PHP server?

The XHRUpload plugin works similarly to a `<form>` upload. You can use the
`$_FILES` variable on the server to work with uploaded files. See the PHP
documentation on [Handling file uploads][php.file-upload].

The default form field for file uploads is `files[]`, which means you have to
access the `$_FILES` array as described in [Uploading many files][php.multiple]:

```php
<?php
// upload.php
$files = $_FILES['files'];
$file_path = $files['tmp_name'][0]; // temporary upload path of the first file
$file_name = $_POST['name']; // desired name of the file
move_uploaded_file($file_path, './img/' . basename($file_name)); // save the file in `img/`
```

Note how we are using `$_POST['name']` instead of `$my_file['name']`.
`$my_file['name']` has the original name of the file on the user’s device.
`$_POST['name']` has the `name` metadata value for the uploaded file, which can
be edited by the user using the [Dashboard](/docs/dashboard).

Set a custom `fieldName` to make working with the `$_FILES` array a bit less
convoluted:

```js
// app.js
uppy.use(XHRUpload, {
	endpoint: '/upload.php',
	fieldName: 'my_file',
});
```

```php
<?php
// upload.php
$my_file = $_FILES['my_file'];
$file_path = $my_file['tmp_name']; // temporary upload path of the file
$file_name = $_POST['name']; // desired name of the file
move_uploaded_file($file_path, $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . '/img/' . basename($file_name)); // save the file at `img/FILE_NAME`
```
