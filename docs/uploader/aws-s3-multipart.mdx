# AWS S3 Multipart

The `@uppy/aws-s3-multipart` plugin can be used to upload files directly to an
S3 bucket (or S3-compatible provider) using S3’s Multipart uploader.

## When should I use it?

:::tip

Not sure which uploader is best for you? Read
“[Choosing the uploader you need](/docs/guides/choosing-uploader)”.

:::

You can use this plugin when you prefer a _client-to-storage_ over a
_client-to-server-to-storage_ (such as [Transloadit](/docs/transloadit) or
[Tus](/docs/tus)) setup. This may in some cases be preferable, for instance, to
reduce costs or the complexity of running a server and load balancer with
[Tus](/docs/tus).

`@uppy/aws-s3-multipart` starts to become valuable for larger files
(100&nbsp;MB+) as it uploads a single object as a set of parts. This has certain
benefits, such as improved throughput (uploading parts in parallel) and quick
recovery from network issues (only the failed parts need to be retried). The
downside is request overhead, as it needs to do creation, signing, and
completion requests besides the upload requests. For example, if you are
uploading files that are only a couple kilobytes with a 100ms roundtrip latency,
you are spending 400ms on overhead and only a few milliseconds on uploading.

If you are uploading large files (100&nbsp;MB+), we recommend
`@uppy/aws-s3-multipart`, otherwise [`@uppy/aws-s3`][].

## Use

### Setting up your S3 bucket

To use this plugin with S3 we need to setup a bucket with the right permissions
and CORS settings.

S3 buckets do not allow public uploads for security reasons. To allow Uppy and
the browser to upload directly to a bucket, its CORS permissions need to be
configured.

CORS permissions can be found in the
[S3 Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home). Click the
bucket that will receive the uploads, then go into the `Permissions` tab and
select the `CORS configuration` button. A JSON document will be shown that
defines the CORS configuration. (AWS used to use XML but now only allow JSON).
More information about the
[S3 CORS format here](https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ManageCorsUsing.html).

The configuration required for Uppy and Companion is this:

```json
[
	{
		"AllowedOrigins": ["https://my-app.com"],
		"AllowedMethods": ["GET", "PUT"],
		"MaxAgeSeconds": 3000,
		"AllowedHeaders": [
			"Authorization",
			"x-amz-date",
			"x-amz-content-sha256",
			"content-type"
		],
		"ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"]
	},
	{
		"AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
		"AllowedMethods": ["GET"],
		"MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
	}
]
```

A good practice is to use two CORS rules: one for viewing the uploaded files,
and one for uploading files. This is done above where the first object in the
array defines the rules for uploading, and the second for viewing. The example
above **makes files publically viewable**. You can change it according to your
needs.

If you are using an IAM policy to allow access to the S3 bucket, the policy must
have at least the `s3:PutObject` and `s3:PutObjectAcl` permissions scoped to the
bucket in question. In-depth documentation about CORS rules is available on the
[AWS documentation site](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html).

### Use with your own server

The recommended approach is to integrate `@uppy/aws-s3-multipart` with your own
server. You will need to do the following things:

1. [Setup up a S3 bucket](#setting-up-your-s3-bucket)
2. Create endpoints in your server. You can create them as edge functions (such
   as AWS Lambdas), inside Next.js as an API route, or wherever your server runs
   - `POST` > `/uppy/s3`: create the multipart upload
   - `GET` > `/uppy/s3/:id`: get the uploaded parts
   - `GET` > `/uppy/s3/:id/:partNumber`: sign the part and return a pre-signed
     URL
   - `POST` > `/uppy/s3/:id/complete`: complete the multipart upload
   - `DELETE` > `/uppy/s3/:id`: abort the multipart upload
3. [Setup Uppy](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/main/examples/aws-nodejs/public/index.html)

### Use with Companion

[Companion](/docs/companion) has S3 routes built-in for a plug-and-play
experience with Uppy.

:::caution

Generally it’s better for access control, observability, and scaling to
integrate `@uppy/aws-s3-multipart` with your own server. You may want to use
[Companion](/docs/companion) for creating, signing, and completing your S3
uploads if you already need Companion for remote files (such as from Google
Drive). Otherwise it’s not worth the hosting effort.

:::

```js {10} showLineNumbers
import Uppy from '@uppy/core';
import Dashboard from '@uppy/dashboard';
import AwsS3Multipart from '@uppy/aws-s3-multipart';

import '@uppy/core/dist/style.min.css';
import '@uppy/dashboard/dist/style.min.css';

const uppy = new Uppy()
	.use(Dashboard, { inline: true, target: 'body' })
	.use(AwsS3Multipart, { companionUrl: 'http://companion.uppy.io' });
```

## API

### Options

#### `limit`

The maximum amount of files to upload in parallel (`number`, default: `6`).

Note that the amount of files is not the same as the amount of concurrent
connections. Multipart uploads can use many requests per file. For example, for
a 100 MB file with a part size of 5 MB:

- 1 creation request
- 100/5 = 20 sign requests
- 100/5 = 20 upload requests
- 1 complete request

:::caution

Unless you have a good reason and are well informed about the average internet
speed of your users, do not set this higher. S3 uses HTTP/1.1, which means a
limit to concurrent connections and your uploads may expire before they are
uploaded.

:::

#### `companionUrl`

URL to a [Companion](/docs/companion) instance (`string`, default: `null`).

#### `companionHeaders`

Custom headers that should be sent along to [Companion](/docs/companion) on
every request (`Object`, default: `{}`).

#### `companionCookiesRule`

This option correlates to the
[RequestCredentials value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/credentials)
(`string`, default: `'same-origin'`).

This tells the plugin whether to send cookies to [Companion](/docs/companion).

#### `retryDelays`

`retryDelays` are the intervals in milliseconds used to retry a failed chunk
(`array`, default: `[0, 1000, 3000, 5000]`).

This is also used for [`signPart()`](#signpartfile-partdata). Set to `null` to
disable automatic retries, and fail instantly if any chunk fails to upload.

#### `getChunkSize(file)`

A function that returns the minimum chunk size to use when uploading the given
file.

The S3 Multipart plugin uploads files in chunks. Chunks are sent in batches to
have presigned URLs generated with [`signPart()`](#signpartfile-partdata). To
reduce the amount of requests for large files, you can choose a larger chunk
size, at the cost of having to re-upload more data if one chunk fails to upload.

S3 requires a minimum chunk size of 5MB, and supports at most 10,000 chunks per
multipart upload. If `getChunkSize()` returns a size that’s too small, Uppy will
increase it to S3’s minimum requirements.

#### `createMultipartUpload(file)`

A function that calls the S3 Multipart API to create a new upload.

`file` is the file object from Uppy’s state. The most relevant keys are
`file.name` and `file.type`.

Return a Promise for an object with keys:

- `uploadId` - The UploadID returned by S3.
- `key` - The object key for the file. This needs to be returned to allow it to
  be different from the `file.name`.

The default implementation calls out to Companion’s S3 signing endpoints.

#### `listParts(file, { uploadId, key })`

A function that calls the S3 Multipart API to list the parts of a file that have
already been uploaded.

Receives the `file` object from Uppy’s state, and an object with keys:

- `uploadId` - The UploadID of this Multipart upload.
- `key` - The object key of this Multipart upload.

Return a Promise for an array of S3 Part objects, as returned by the S3
Multipart API. Each object has keys:

- `PartNumber` - The index in the file of the uploaded part.
- `Size` - The size of the part in bytes.
- `ETag` - The ETag of the part, used to identify it when completing the
  multipart upload and combining all parts into a single file.

The default implementation calls out to Companion’s S3 signing endpoints.

#### `signPart(file, partData)`

A function that generates a signed URL for the specified part number. The
`partData` argument is an object with the keys:

- `uploadId` - The UploadID of this Multipart upload.
- `key` - The object key in the S3 bucket.
- `partNumber` - can’t be zero.
- `body` – The data that will be signed.
- `signal` – An `AbortSignal` that may be used to abort an ongoing request.

This function should return a object, or a promise that resolves to an object,
with the following keys:

- `url` – the presigned URL, as a `string`.
- `headers` – **(Optional)** Custom headers to send along with the request to S3
  endpoint.

An example of what the return value should look like:

```json
{
	"url": "https://bucket.region.amazonaws.com/path/to/file.jpg?partNumber=1&...",
	"headers": { "Content-MD5": "foo" }
}
```

#### `abortMultipartUpload(file, { uploadId, key })`

A function that calls the S3 Multipart API to abort a Multipart upload, and
removes all parts that have been uploaded so far.

Receives the `file` object from Uppy’s state, and an object with keys:

- `uploadId` - The UploadID of this Multipart upload.
- `key` - The object key of this Multipart upload.

This is typically called when the user cancels an upload. Cancellation cannot
fail in Uppy, so the result of this function is ignored.

The default implementation calls out to Companion’s S3 signing endpoints.

#### `completeMultipartUpload(file, { uploadId, key, parts })`

A function that calls the S3 Multipart API to complete a Multipart upload,
combining all parts into a single object in the S3 bucket.

Receives the `file` object from Uppy’s state, and an object with keys:

- `uploadId` - The UploadID of this Multipart upload.
- `key` - The object key of this Multipart upload.
- `parts` - S3-style list of parts, an array of objects with `ETag` and
  `PartNumber` properties. This can be passed straight to S3’s Multipart API.

Return a Promise for an object with properties:

- `location` - **(Optional)** A publically accessible URL to the object in the
  S3 bucket.

The default implementation calls out to Companion’s S3 signing endpoints.

#### `allowedMetaFields: null`

Pass an array of field names to limit the metadata fields that will be added to
upload as query parameters.

- Set this to `['name']` to only send the `name` field.
- Set this to `null` (the default) to send _all_ metadata fields.
- Set this to an empty array `[]` to not send any fields.

<details>
<summary>Deprecated options</summary>

#### `prepareUploadParts(file, partData)`

A function that generates a batch of signed URLs for the specified part numbers.

Receives the `file` object from Uppy’s state. The `partData` argument is an
object with keys:

- `uploadId` - The UploadID of this Multipart upload.
- `key` - The object key in the S3 bucket.
- `parts` - An array of objects with the part number and chunk
  (`Array<{ number: number, chunk: blob }>`). `number` can’t be zero.

`prepareUploadParts` should return a `Promise` with an `Object` with keys:

- `presignedUrls` - A JavaScript object with the part numbers as keys and the
  presigned URL for each part as the value.
- `headers` - **(Optional)** Custom headers to send along with every request per
  part (`{ 1: { 'Content-MD5': 'hash' }}`). These are (1-based) indexed by part
  number too so you can for instance send the MD5 hash validation for each part
  to S3.

An example of what the return value should look like:

```json
{
	"presignedUrls": {
		"1": "https://bucket.region.amazonaws.com/path/to/file.jpg?partNumber=1&...",
		"2": "https://bucket.region.amazonaws.com/path/to/file.jpg?partNumber=2&...",
		"3": "https://bucket.region.amazonaws.com/path/to/file.jpg?partNumber=3&..."
	},
	"headers": {
		"1": { "Content-MD5": "foo" },
		"2": { "Content-MD5": "bar" },
		"3": { "Content-MD5": "baz" }
	}
}
```

If an error occured, reject the `Promise` with an `Object` with the following
keys:

```json
{ "source": { "status": 500 } }
```

`status` is the HTTP code and is required for determining whether to retry the
request. `prepareUploadParts` will be retried if the code is `0`, `409`, `423`,
or between `500` and `600`.
