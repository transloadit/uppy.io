#### `id`

A unique identifier for this plugin (`string`, default is a unique ID for each
plugin).

#### `title`

Title / name shown in the UI, such as Dashboard tabs (`string`, default is the
name of the plugin).

#### `target`

DOM element, CSS selector, or plugin to place the drag and drop area into
(`string`, `Element`, `Function`, or `UIPlugin`, default:
[`Dashboard`](/docs/dashboard)).

#### `companionUrl`

URL to a [Companion](/docs/companion) instance (`string`, default: `null`).

#### `companionHeaders`

Custom headers that should be sent along to [Companion](/docs/companion) on
every request (`Object`, default: `{}`).

#### `companionAllowedHosts`

The valid and authorised URL(s) from which OAuth responses should be accepted
(`string` or `RegExp` or `Array`). This option is useful when you have your
[Companion](/docs/companion) running on several hosts. Otherwise, the default
value should do fine, which uses the origin of `companionUrl`.

This value can be a `string`, a `RegExp` pattern, or an `Array` of these.
Strings are evaluated as regular expressions too and will be wrapped in a RegExp
like so:

```js
new RegExp(`^${value}$`);
```

**Important:** You must escape regex characters like `.`, or you might open your
app up to security vulnerabilities.

- Example correct strings
  - `'^(?:.*\\.)?example\.com$'` matches `example.com` and all of its
    subdomains.
  - `'https://example\.com'` matches `https://example.com` only.
- Example vulnerability: `'https://www.example.com'` would allow an attacker
  with the domain `wwwxexample.com` to forge and inject a fraudulent token into
  Uppy.

#### `companionCookiesRule`

This option correlates to the
[RequestCredentials value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/credentials)
(`string`, default: `'same-origin'`).

This tells the plugin whether to send cookies to [Companion](/docs/companion).

#### `locale`

An object with `strings` property containing additional i18n strings. The key is
the i18n key and the value is the English string.

Example:

```js
{
	strings: {
		someKey: 'Some English string',
	},
}
```

#### `storage`

A custom storage to be used for the pluginâ€™s persistent data. Type `AsyncStore`,
default is `LocalStorage`.
