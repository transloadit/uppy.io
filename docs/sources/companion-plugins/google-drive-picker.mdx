# Google Drive Picker

The `@uppy/google-drive-picker` plugin lets users import files from their
[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) account using the new
[Picker API](https://developers.google.com/drive/picker).

A [Companion](/docs/companion) instance is required for the Google Drive Picker
plugin to work. Companion downloads the files from Google Drive, and uploads
them to the destination. This saves the user bandwidth, especially helpful if
they are on a mobile connection.

You can self-host Companion or get a hosted version with any
[Transloadit plan](https://transloadit.com/pricing/).

See also [Google Photos Picker](./google-photos-picker.mdx).

## When should I use this?

When you want to let users import files from their
[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) account.

You should use this plugin over our other
[Google Drive plugin](/docs/google-drive) if you want to avoid using a
restricted API scope, which requires CASA Tier 2 compliance.

The downside of using the Picker UI made by Google is less controls, inability
to select folders, downloading an additional bundle, and a less consistent user
experience.

## Use

Using Google Drive Picker requires setup in both Uppy and Companion.

### Initial setup

To sign up for API keys, go to the
[Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).

Create a project for your app if you don’t have one yet.

- On the project’s dashboard, enable the
  [Google Picker API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/picker.googleapis.com)
  (for Google Drive).
- Create an API key. Restrict your API key to the Google Picker API for safety.
- Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID of type Web application with the correct
  Authorized JavaScript origins.

### Use in Uppy

```js {10-13} showLineNumbers
import Uppy from '@uppy/core';
import Dashboard from '@uppy/dashboard';
import GoogleDrivePicker from '@uppy/google-drive-picker';

import '@uppy/core/dist/style.min.css';
import '@uppy/dashboard/dist/style.min.css';

new Uppy()
	.use(Dashboard, { inline: true, target: '#dashboard' })
	.use(GoogleDrivePicker, {
		companionUrl: 'https://your-companion.com',
		clientId: 'From Google Developer Console',
		apiKey: 'From Google Developer Console',
		appId: 'From Google Developer Console',
	});
```

### Use with Transloadit

```js
import { COMPANION_URL, COMPANION_ALLOWED_HOSTS } from '@uppy/transloadit';
import GoogleDrivePicker from '@uppy/google-drive-picker';

uppy.use(GoogleDrivePicker, {
	companionUrl: COMPANION_URL,
	companionAllowedHosts: COMPANION_ALLOWED_HOSTS,
	clientId: 'From Google Developer Console',
	apiKey: 'From Google Developer Console',
	appId: 'From Google Developer Console',
});
```

### Use in Companion

Companion is used to download/upload the picked files. Companion supports this
plugin out-of-the-box, however it must be enabled in Companion with the
`enableGooglePickerEndpoint` / `COMPANION_ENABLE_GOOGLE_PICKER_ENDPOINT` option.
For this plugin, all credentials are public (non-secret) and provided in the
frontend.

## API

### Options

<CompanionOptions />

#### `clientId`

The client ID from the [Initial setup](#initial-setup) (`string`).

#### `apiKey`

The API key from the [Initial setup](#initial-setup) (`string`).

#### `appId`

The App ID can be found in the
[Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com)
`Project number` under `IAM & Admin` > `Settings`. Note that if this is set to
an invalid value it will be ignored by Google when your project is in testing
mode, but once in production you will get 404 errors when trying to download
files.
