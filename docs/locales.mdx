# Internationalisation

Uppy speaks many languages, English being the default. You can use a locale pack
to translate Uppy into your language of choice.

:::tip

Checkout
[`@uppy/locales`](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/tree/main/packages/%40uppy/locales)
on GitHub to see the list of supported languages.

:::

## Using a locale pack from npm

This is the recommded way. Install `@uppy/locales` package from npm, then choose
the locale you‚Äôd like to use: `@uppy/locales/lib/LANGUAGE_CODE`.

```bash
npm i @uppy/core @uppy/locales
```

```js
import Uppy from '@uppy/core';
import German from '@uppy/locales/lib/de_DE';
// see below for the full list of locales
const uppy = new Uppy({
	debug: true,
	locale: German,
});
```

## Using a locale pack from CDN

Add a `<script>` tag with Uppy bundle and the locale pack you‚Äôd like to use. You
can copy/paste the link from the CDN column in the locales table. The locale
will attach itself to the `Uppy.locales` object.

```html
<script src="https://releases.transloadit.com/uppy/v3.6.1/uppy.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://releases.transloadit.com/uppy/locales/v3.0.7/de_DE.min.js"></script>

<script>
	var uppy = new Uppy.Uppy({
		debug: true,
		locale: Uppy.locales.de_DE,
	});
</script>
```

## Overriding locale strings for a specific plugin

Many plugins come with their own locale strings, and the packs we provide
consist of most of those strings. You can, however, override a locale string for
a specific plugin, regardless of whether you are using locale pack or not. See
the plugin documentation for the list of locale strings it uses.

```js
import Uppy from '@uppy/core';
import DragDrop from '@uppy/drag-drop';
import Russian from '@uppy/locales/lib/ru_RU';

const uppy = new Uppy({
	debug: true,
	autoProceed: true,
	locale: Russian,
});
uppy.use(DragDrop, {
	target: '.UppyDragDrop',
	// We are using the ru_RU locale pack (set above in Uppy options),
	// but you can also override specific strings like so:
	locale: {
		strings: {
			browse: '–≤—ã–±–µ—Ä–∏—Ç–µ ;-)',
		},
	},
});
```

## Contributing a new language

If you speak a language we don‚Äôt yet support, you can contribute! Here‚Äôs how you
do it:

1. Go to the
   [uppy/locales](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/tree/main/packages/%40uppy/locales/src)
   directory in the Uppy GitHub repo.
2. Go to `en_US.js` and copy its contents, as English is the most up-to-date
   locale.
3. Press ‚ÄúCreate new file‚Äù, name it according to the
   [`language_COUNTRY` format](http://www.i18nguy.com/unicode/language-identifiers.html),
   make sure to use underscore `_` as a divider. Examples: `en_US`, `en_GB`,
   `ru_RU`, `ar_AE`. Variants should be trailing, for example `sr_RS_Latin` for
   Serbian Latin vs Cyrillic.
4. If your language has different pluralization rules than English, update the
   `pluralize` implementation. If you are unsure how to do this, please ask us
   for help in a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/new).
5. Paste what you‚Äôve copied from `en_US.js` and use it as a starting point to
   translate strings into your language.
6. When you are ready, save the file ‚Äî this should create a PR that we‚Äôll then
   review üéâ Thanks!
