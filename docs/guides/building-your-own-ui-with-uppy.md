# Building your own UI with Uppy

:::note

This guide is in progress.

:::

If you want to use Uppy with your own UI, you would have to instantiate the `Uppy` class and call methods on this instance as well as hook into events in order to react to changes in Uppy. See [Uppy core](/docs/uppy/) and [React examples](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/tree/main/examples/react).
