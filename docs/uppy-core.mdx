# Uppy core

Uppy can be an uploader and an interface with a lot of features. Features can be
added incrementally with plugins, but Uppy can be as bare bones as you want it
to be. So we build Uppy’s heart, `@uppy/core`, as a standalone orchestrator. It
acts as a state manager, event emitter, and restrictions handler.

## When should I use it?

`@uppy/core` is the fundament of the Uppy ecosystem, the orchestrator for all
added plugins. No matter the uploading experience you’re looking for, it all
starts with installing this plugin.

You can use `@uppy/core` and
[build your own UI](/docs/guides/building-your-own-ui-with-uppy) or go for the
[Dashboard](/docs/dashboard) integration. For an uploading plugin, you can refer
to [choosing the uploader you need](/docs/guides/choosing-uploader).

If you want to see how it all comes together, checkout the
[examples](/examples).

## Install

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM" default>

```shell
npm install @uppy/core
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```shell
yarn add @uppy/core
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="cdn" label="CDN">
    <UppyCdnExample>
      {`
        import { Uppy } from "{{UPPY_JS_URL}}"
        const uppy = new Uppy()
      `}
    </UppyCdnExample>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Use

`@uppy/core` has four exports: `Uppy`, `UIPlugin`, `BasePlugin`, and
`debugLogger`. The default export is the `Uppy` class.

### Working with Uppy files

Uppy keeps files in state with the [`File`][] browser API, but it’s wrapped in
an `Object` to be able to add more data to it, which we call an _Uppy file_. All
these properties can be useful for plugins and side-effects (such as
[events](#events)).

Mutating these properties should be done through [methods](#methods).

<details>
  <summary>Uppy file properties</summary>

#### `file.source`

Name of the plugin that was responsible for adding this file. Typically a remote
provider plugin like `'GoogleDrive'` or a UI plugin like `'DragDrop'`.

#### `file.id`

Unique ID for the file.

#### `file.name`

The name of the file.

#### `file.meta`

Object containing standard as well as user-defined metadata for each file. Any
custom file metadata should be JSON-serializable. The following standard
metadata will be stored on all file objects, but plugins may add more metadata.

- `file.meta.name`
  - Same as `file.name`.
- `file.meta.type`
  - Same as `file.type`.
- `file.meta.relativePath`
  - For any local folder that was drag-dropped or opened in Uppy, the files
    inside the folder will have the `relativePath` metadata field set to their
    path, relative to the folder. `relativePath` begins with the folder’s name
    and ends with the file’s name. If opening or drag-dropping a file instead of
    a folder, `relativePath` will be `null`. The same behaviour exists for
    remote (provider) files, but the path will instead be relative to the user’s
    selection (checkboxes). No leading or trailing slashes.
  - **Local file example:** When drag-dropping a local folder `folder1` which
    has a folder inside of it named `folder2` which has a file named `file`
    inside of it, the `relativePath` meta field of the file will be
    `folder1/folder2/file`. However if drag-dropping or opening `file` directly,
    `relativePath` will be `null`.
  - **Remote file example:** Suppose we have a remote provider folder structure
    such as `/folder1/folder2/file`. Then, if the user checks the checkbox next
    to `folder1`, `file`’s `relativePath` will be `"folder1/folder2/file"`.
    However if the user first navigates into `folder1`, and only then checks the
    checkbox next to `folder2`, `relativePath` will be `"folder2/file"`.
- `file.meta.absolutePath`
  - The `absolutePath` meta field will only be set for remote files. Regardless
    of user selection, it will always be the path relative to the root of the
    provider’s list of files, as presented to the user. `absolutePath` always
    begins with a `/` and will always end with the file’s name. To clarify: The
    difference between `absolutePath` and `relativePath` is that `absolutePath`
    only exists for remote files, and always has the full path to the file,
    while `relativePath` is the file’s path _relative to the user’s selected
    folder_.

#### `file.type`

MIME type of the file. This may actually be guessed if a file type was not
provided by the user’s browser, so this is a best-effort value and not
guaranteed to be correct.

#### `file.data`

For local files, this is the actual [`File`][] or [`Blob`][] object representing
the file contents.

For files that are imported from remote providers, the file data is not
available in the browser.

[`file`]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File
[`blob`]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob

#### `file.progress`

An object with upload progress data.

**Properties**

- `bytesUploaded` - Number of bytes uploaded so far.
- `bytesTotal` - Number of bytes that must be uploaded in total.
- `uploadStarted` - Null if the upload has not started yet. Once started, this
  property stores a UNIX timestamp. Note that this is only set _after_
  preprocessing.
- `uploadComplete` - Boolean indicating if the upload has completed. Note this
  does _not_ mean that postprocessing has completed, too.
- `percentage` - Integer percentage between 0 and 100.

#### `file.size`

Size in bytes of the file.

#### `file.isRemote`

Boolean: is this file imported from a remote provider?

#### `file.remote`

Grab bag of data for remote providers. Generally not interesting for end users.

#### `file.preview`

An optional URL to a visual thumbnail for the file.

#### `file.uploadURL`

When an upload is completed, this may contain a URL to the uploaded file.
Depending on server configuration it may not be accessible or correct.

</details>

## `new Uppy(options?)`

```js
import Uppy from '@uppy/core';

const uppy = new Uppy();
```

### Options

#### `id`

A site-wide unique ID for the instance (`string`, default: `uppy`).

:::note

If several Uppy instances are being used, for instance, on two different pages,
an `id` should be specified. This allows Uppy to store information in
`localStorage` without colliding with other Uppy instances.

This ID should be persistent across page reloads and navigation—it shouldn’t be
a random number that is different every time Uppy is loaded.

:::

#### `autoProceed`

Upload as soon as files are added (`boolean`, default: `false`).

By default Uppy will wait for an upload button to be pressed in the UI, or the
`.upload()` method to be called before starting an upload. Setting this to
`true` will start uploading automatically after the first file is selected

#### `allowMultipleUploadBatches`

Whether to allow several upload batches (`boolean`, default: `true`).

This means several calls to `.upload()`, or a user adding more files after
already uploading some. An upload batch is made up of the files that were added
since the earlier `.upload()` call.

With this option set to `true`, users can upload some files, and then add _more_
files and upload those as well. A model use case for this is uploading images to
a gallery or adding attachments to an email.

With this option set to `false`, users can upload some files, and you can listen
for the [`'complete'`](#complete) event to continue to the next step in your
app’s upload flow. A typical use case for this is uploading a new profile
picture. If you are integrating with an existing HTML form, this option gives
the closest behaviour to a bare `<input type="file">`.

#### `debug`

Whether to send debugging and warning logs (`boolean`, default: `false`).

Setting this to `true` sets the [`logger`](#logger) to
[`debugLogger`](#debuglogger).

#### `logger`

Logger used for [`uppy.log`](#logmessage-type) (`Object`, default:
`justErrorsLogger`).

By providing your own `logger`, you can send the debug information to a server,
choose to log errors only, etc.

:::note

Set `logger` to [`debugLogger`](#debuglogger) to get debug info output to the
browser console:

:::

:::note

You can also provide your own logger object: it should expose `debug`, `warn`
and `error` methods, as shown in the examples below.

Here’s an example of a `logger` that does nothing:

```js
const nullLogger = {
	debug: (...args) => {},
	warn: (...args) => {},
	error: (...args) => {},
};
```

:::

#### `restrictions`

Conditions for restricting an upload (`Object`, default: `{}`).

| Property             | Value           | Description                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `maxFileSize`        | `number`        | maximum file size in bytes for each individual file                                                                              |
| `minFileSize`        | `number`        | minimum file size in bytes for each individual file                                                                              |
| `maxTotalFileSize`   | `number`        | maximum file size in bytes for all the files that can be selected for upload                                                     |
| `maxNumberOfFiles`   | `number`        | total number of files that can be selected                                                                                       |
| `minNumberOfFiles`   | `number`        | minimum number of files that must be selected before the upload                                                                  |
| `allowedFileTypes`   | `Array`         | wildcards `image/*`, or exact mime types `image/jpeg`, or file extensions `.jpg`: `['image/*', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.gif']` |
| `requiredMetaFields` | `Array<string>` | make keys from the `meta` object in every file required before uploading                                                         |

:::note

`maxNumberOfFiles` also affects the number of files a user is able to select via
the system file dialog in UI plugins like `DragDrop`, `FileInput` and
`Dashboard`. When set to `1`, they will only be able to select a single file.
When `null` or another number is provided, they will be able to select several
files.

:::

:::note

`allowedFileTypes` gets passed to the file system dialog via the
[`<input>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file#Limiting_accepted_file_types)
accept attribute, so only types supported by the browser will work.

:::

:::tip

If you’d like to force a certain meta field data to be entered before the
upload, you can
[do so using `onBeforeUpload`](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/1703#issuecomment-507202561).

:::

:::tip

If you need to restrict `allowedFileTypes` to a file extension with double dots,
like `.nii.gz`, you can do so by
[setting `allowedFileTypes` to the last part of the extension, `allowedFileTypes: ['.gz']`, and then using `onBeforeFileAdded` to filter for `.nii.gz`](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/1822#issuecomment-526801208).

:::

#### `meta`

Key/value pairs to add to each file’s `metadata` (`Object`, default: `{}`).

:::note

Metadata from each file is then attached to uploads in the [Tus](/docs/tus) and
[XHR](/docs/xhr-upload) plugins.

:::

:::info

Two methods also exist for updating `metadata`: [`setMeta`](#setmetadata) and
[`setFileMeta`](#setfilemetafileid-data).

:::

:::info

Metadata can also be added from a `<form>` element on your page, through the
[Form](#) plugin or through the UI if you are using Dashboard with the
[`metaFields`](/docs/dashboard#metafields) option.

:::

<i id="onBeforeFileAdded" />

#### `onBeforeFileAdded(file, files)`

A function called before a file is added to Uppy (`Function`, default:
`(files, file) => !Object.hasOwn(files, file.id)`).

Use this function to run any number of custom checks on the selected file, or
manipulate it, for instance, by optimizing a file name. You can also allow
duplicate files with this.

You can return `true` to keep the file as is, `false` to remove the file, or
return a modified file.

:::caution

This method is intended for quick synchronous checks and modifications only. If
you need to do an async API call, or heavy work on a file (like compression or
encryption), you should use a [custom plugin](/docs/guides/building-plugins)
instead.

:::

:::info

No notification will be shown to the user about a file not passing validation by
default. We recommend showing a message using
[`uppy.info()`](#infomessage-type-duration) and logging to console for debugging
purposes via [`uppy.log()`](#logmessage-type).

:::

<details>
  <summary>Filter, change, and abort example</summary>

Allow all files, also duplicate files. This will replace the file if it has not
been uploaded. If you upload a duplicate file again it depends on your upload
plugin and backend how it is handled.

```js
const uppy = new Uppy({
  // ...
  onBeforeFileAdded: () => true,
```

Keep only files under a condition:

```js
const uppy = new Uppy({
  // ...
  onBeforeFileAdded: (currentFile, files) => {
    if (currentFile.name === 'forest-IMG_0616.jpg') {
      return true
    }
    return false
  },
```

Change all file names:

```js
const uppy = new Uppy({
  // ...
  onBeforeFileAdded: (currentFile, files) => {
    const modifiedFile = {
      ...currentFile,
      name: `${currentFile.name}__${Date.now()}`,
    }
    return modifiedFile
  },
```

Abort a file:

```js
const uppy = new Uppy({
	// ...
	onBeforeFileAdded: (currentFile, files) => {
		if (!currentFile.type) {
			// log to console
			uppy.log(`Skipping file because it has no type`);
			// show error message to the user
			uppy.info(`Skipping file because it has no type`, 'error', 500);
			return false;
		}
	},
});
```

</details>

#### `onBeforeUpload(files)`

A function called before when upload is initiated (`Function`, default:
`(files) => files`).

Use this to check if all files or their total number match your requirements, or
manipulate all the files at once before upload.

You can return `true` to continue the upload, `false` to cancel it, or return
modified files.

:::caution

This method is intended for quick synchronous checks and modifications only. If
you need to do an async API call, or heavy work on a file (like compression or
encryption), you should use a [custom plugin](/docs/guides/building-plugins)
instead.

:::

:::info

No notification will be shown to the user about a file not passing validation by
default. We recommend showing a message using
[`uppy.info()`](#infomessage-type-duration) and logging to console for debugging
purposes via [`uppy.log()`](#logmessage-type).

:::

<details>
  <summary>Change and abort example</summary>

Change all file names:

```js
const uppy = new Uppy({
	// ...
	onBeforeUpload: (files) => {
		// We’ll be careful to return a new object, not mutating the original `files`
		const updatedFiles = {};
		Object.keys(files).forEach((fileID) => {
			updatedFiles[fileID] = {
				...files[fileID],
				name: `${myCustomPrefix}__${files[fileID].name}`,
			};
		});
		return updatedFiles;
	},
});
```

Abort an upload:

```js
const uppy = new Uppy({
	// ...
	onBeforeUpload: (files) => {
		if (Object.keys(files).length < 2) {
			// log to console
			uppy.log(
				`Aborting upload because only ${
					Object.keys(files).length
				} files were selected`,
			);
			// show error message to the user
			uppy.info(`You have to select at least 2 files`, 'error', 500);
			return false;
		}
		return true;
	},
});
```

</details>

#### `locale`

You can override locale strings by passing the `strings` object with the keys
you want to override.

:::note

Array indexed objects are used for pluralisation.

:::

:::info

If you want a different language it’s better to use [locales](/docs/locales).

:::

```js
module.exports = {
	strings: {
		addBulkFilesFailed: {
			0: 'Failed to add %{smart_count} file due to an internal error',
			1: 'Failed to add %{smart_count} files due to internal errors',
		},
		youCanOnlyUploadX: {
			0: 'You can only upload %{smart_count} file',
			1: 'You can only upload %{smart_count} files',

		folderAlreadyAdded: 'The folder "%{folder}" was already added',
		folderAdded: {
			0: 'Added %{smart_count} file from %{folder}',
			1: 'Added %{smart_count} files from %{folder}',
		},
	},
};
```

#### `store`

The store that is used to keep track of internal state (`Object`, default:
[`DefaultStore`](/docs/guides/custom-stores)).

This option can be used to plug Uppy state into an external state management
library, such as [Redux](/docs/guides/custom-stores).

{/* TODO document store API */}

#### `infoTimeout`

How long an [Informer](/docs/informer) notification will be visible (`number`,
default: `5000`).

### Methods

#### `use(plugin, opts)`

Add a plugin to Uppy, with an optional plugin options object.

```js
import Uppy from '@uppy/core';
import DragDrop from '@uppy/drag-drop';

const uppy = new Uppy();
uppy.use(DragDrop, { target: 'body' });
```

#### `removePlugin(instance)`

Uninstall and remove a plugin.

#### `getPlugin(id)`

Get a plugin by its `id` to access its methods.

#### `getID()`

Get the Uppy instance ID, see the [`id`](#id) option.

#### `addFile(file)`

Add a new file to Uppy’s internal state. `addFile` will return the generated id
for the file that was added.

`addFile` gives an error if the file cannot be added, either because
`onBeforeFileAdded(file)` gave an error, or because `uppy.opts.restrictions`
checks failed.

```js
uppy.addFile({
	name: 'my-file.jpg', // file name
	type: 'image/jpeg', // file type
	data: blob, // file blob
	meta: {
		// optional, store the directory path of a file so Uppy can tell identical files in different directories apart.
		relativePath: webkitFileSystemEntry.relativePath,
	},
	source: 'Local', // optional, determines the source of the file, for example, Instagram.
	isRemote: false, // optional, set to true if actual file is not in the browser, but on some remote server, for example,
	// when using companion in combination with Instagram.
});
```

:::note

If you try to add a file that already exists, `addFile` will throw an error.
Unless that duplicate file was dropped with a folder — duplicate files from
different folders are allowed, when selected with that folder. This is because
we add `file.meta.relativePath` to the `file.id`.

:::

:::info

Checkout [working with Uppy files](#working-with-uppy-files).

:::

:::info

If `uppy.opts.autoProceed === true`, Uppy will begin uploading automatically
when files are added.

:::

:::info

Sometimes you might need to add a remote file to Uppy. This can be achieved by
[fetching the file, then creating a Blob object, or using the Url plugin with Companion](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/1006#issuecomment-413495493).

:::

:::info

Sometimes you might need to mark some files as “already uploaded”, so that the
user sees them, but they won’t actually be uploaded by Uppy. This can be
achieved by
[looping through files and setting `uploadComplete: true, uploadStarted: true` on them](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/1112#issuecomment-432339569)

:::

#### `removeFile(fileID)`

Remove a file from Uppy. Removing a file that is already being uploaded cancels
that upload.

```js
uppy.removeFile('uppyteamkongjpg1501851828779');
```

#### `getFile(fileID)`

Get a specific [Uppy file](#working-with-uppy-files) by its ID.

```js
const file = uppy.getFile('uppyteamkongjpg1501851828779');
```

#### `getFiles()`

Get an array of all added [Uppy files](#working-with-uppy-files).

```js
const files = uppy.getFiles();
```

#### `upload()`

Start uploading added files.

Returns a Promise `result` that resolves with an object containing two arrays of
uploaded files:

- `result.successful` - Files that were uploaded successfully.
- `result.failed` - Files that did not upload successfully. These files will
  have a `.error` property describing what went wrong.

```js
uppy.upload().then((result) => {
	console.info('Successful uploads:', result.successful);

	if (result.failed.length > 0) {
		console.error('Errors:');
		result.failed.forEach((file) => {
			console.error(file.error);
		});
	}
});
```

#### `pauseResume(fileID)`

Toggle pause/resume on an upload. Will only work if resumable upload plugin,
such as [Tus](/docs/tus/), is used.

#### `pauseAll()`

Pause all uploads. Will only work if a resumable upload plugin, such as
[Tus](/docs/tus/), is used.

#### `resumeAll()`

Resume all uploads. Will only work if resumable upload plugin, such as
[Tus](/docs/tus/), is used.

#### `retryUpload(fileID)`

Retry an upload (after an error, for example).

#### `retryAll()`

Retry all uploads (after an error, for example).

#### `cancelAll({ reason: 'user' })`

| Argument | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `reason` | `string` | The reason for canceling. Plugins can use this to provide different cleanup behavior (Transloadit plugin cancels an Assembly if user clicked on the “cancel” button). Possible values are: `user` (default) - The user has pressed “cancel”; `unmount` - The Uppy instance has been closed programmatically |

Cancel all uploads, reset progress and remove all files.

#### `setState(patch)`

Update Uppy’s internal state. Usually, this method is called internally, but in
some cases it might be useful to alter something directly, especially when
implementing your own plugins.

Uppy’s default state on initialization:

```js
const state = {
	plugins: {},
	files: {},
	currentUploads: {},
	capabilities: {
		resumableUploads: false,
	},
	totalProgress: 0,
	meta: { ...this.opts.meta },
	info: {
		isHidden: true,
		type: 'info',
		message: '',
	},
};
```

Updating state:

```js
uppy.setState({ smth: true });
```

:::note

State in Uppy is considered to be immutable. When updating values, make sure not
mutate them, but instead create copies. See
[Redux docs](http://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/UsingObjectSpreadOperator.html)
for more info on this.

:::

#### `getState()`

Returns the current state from the [Store](#store).

#### `setFileState(fileID, state)`

Update the state for a single file. This is mostly useful for plugins that may
want to store data on [Uppy files](#working-with-uppy-files), or need to pass
file-specific configurations to other plugins that support it.

`fileID` is the string file ID. `state` is an object that will be merged into
the file’s state object.

#### `setMeta(data)`

Alters global `meta` object in state, the one that can be set in Uppy options
and gets merged with all newly added files. Calling `setMeta` will also merge
newly added meta data with files that had been selected before.

```js
uppy.setMeta({ resize: 1500, token: 'ab5kjfg' });
```

#### `setFileMeta(fileID, data)`

Update metadata for a specific file.

```js
uppy.setFileMeta('myfileID', { resize: 1500 });
```

#### `setOptions(opts)`

Change the options Uppy initialized with.

```js
const uppy = new Uppy();

uppy.setOptions({
	restrictions: { maxNumberOfFiles: 3 },
	autoProceed: true,
});

uppy.setOptions({
	locale: {
		strings: {
			cancel: 'Отмена',
		},
	},
});
```

You can also change options for plugin:

```js
// Change width of the Dashboard drag-and-drop aread on the fly
uppy.getPlugin('Dashboard').setOptions({
	width: 300,
});
```

#### `close({ reason: 'user' })`

| Argument | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `reason` | `string` | The reason for canceling. Plugins can use this to provide different cleanup behavior (Transloadit plugin cancels an Assembly if user clicked on the “cancel” button). Possible values are: `user` (default) - The user has pressed “cancel”; `unmount` - The Uppy instance has been closed programmatically |

Uninstall all plugins and close down this Uppy instance. Also runs
`uppy.cancelAll()` before uninstalling.

#### `logout()`

Calls `provider.logout()` on each remote provider plugin (Google Drive,
Instagram, etc). Useful, for example, after your users log out of their account
in your app — this will clean things up with Uppy cloud providers as well, for
extra security.

#### `log(message, type)`

| Argument  | Type      | Description                 |
| --------- | --------- | --------------------------- |
| `message` | `string`  | message to log              |
| `type`    | `string?` | `debug`, `warn`, or `error` |

See [`logger`](#logger) docs for details.

```js
uppy.log('[Dashboard] adding files...');
```

#### `info(message, type, duration)`

Sets a message in state, with optional details, that can be shown by
notification UI plugins. It’s using the [Informer](/docs/informer) plugin,
included by default in Dashboard.

| Argument   | Type               | Description                                                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `message`  | `string`, `Object` | `'info message'` or `{ message: 'Oh no!', details: 'File couldn’t be uploaded' }` |
| `type`     | `string?`          | `'info'`, `'warning'`, `'success'` or `'error'`                                   |
| `duration` | `number?`          | in milliseconds                                                                   |

`info-visible` and `info-hidden` events are emitted when this info message
should be visible or hidden.

```js
this.info('Oh my, something good happened!', 'success', 3000);
```

```js
this.info(
	{
		message: 'Oh no, something bad happened!',
		details:
			'File couldn’t be uploaded because there is no internet connection',
	},
	'error',
	5000,
);
```

#### `addPreProcessor(fn)`

Add a preprocessing function. `fn` gets called with a list of file IDs before an
upload starts. `fn` should return a Promise. Its resolution value is ignored.

:::info

To change file data and such, use Uppy state updates, for example using
[`setFileState`](#setfilestatefileid-state).

:::

#### `addUploader(fn)`

Add an uploader function. `fn` gets called with a list of file IDs when an
upload should start. Uploader functions should do the actual uploading work,
such as creating and sending an XMLHttpRequest or calling into some upload
service SDK. `fn` should return a Promise that resolves once all files have been
uploaded.

:::tip

You may choose to still resolve the Promise if some file uploads fail. This way,
any postprocessing will still run on the files that were uploaded successfully,
while uploads that failed will be retried when [`retryAll`](#retryall) is
called.

:::

#### `addPostProcessor(fn)`

Add a postprocessing function. `fn` is called with a list of file IDs when an
upload has finished. `fn` should return a Promise that resolves when the
processing work is complete. The value of the Promise is ignored.

For example, you could wait for file encoding or CDN propagation to complete, or
you could do an HTTP API call to create an album containing all images that were
uploaded.

#### `removePreProcessor/removeUploader/removePostProcessor(fn)`

Remove a processor or uploader function that was added before. Normally, this
should be done in the [`uninstall()`](#uninstall) method.

#### `on('event', action)`

Subscribe to an uppy-event. See below for the full list of events.

#### `once('event', action)`

Create an event listener that fires once. See below for the full list of events.

#### `off('event', action)`

Unsubscribe to an uppy-event. See below for the full list of events.

### Events

Uppy exposes events that you can subscribe to for side-effects.

#### `file-added`

Fired each time a file is added.

**Parameters**

- `file` - The [Uppy file](#working-with-uppy-files) that was added.

```js
uppy.on('file-added', (file) => {
	console.log('Added file', file);
});
```

#### `files-added`

**Parameters**

#### `file-removed`

Fired each time a file is removed.

**Parameters**

- `file` - The [Uppy file](#working-with-uppy-files) that was removed.
- `reason` - A string explaining why the file was removed. See
  [#2301](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/2301#issue-628931176) for
  details. Current reasons are: `removed-by-user` and `cancel-all`.

**Example**

```js
uppy.on('file-removed', (file, reason) => {
	console.log('Removed file', file);
});
```

```js
uppy.on('file-removed', (file, reason) => {
	removeFileFromUploadingCounterUI(file);

	if (reason === 'removed-by-user') {
		sendDeleteRequestForFile(file);
	}
});
```

#### `upload`

Fired when the upload starts.

```js
uppy.on('upload', (data) => {
	// data object consists of `id` with upload ID and `fileIDs` array
	// with file IDs in current upload
	// data: { id, fileIDs }
	console.log(`Starting upload ${id} for files ${fileIDs}`);
});
```

#### `preprocess-progress`

Progress of the pre-processors.

**Parameters**

`progress` is an object with properties:

- `mode` - Either `'determinate'` or `'indeterminate'`.
- `message` - A message to show to the user. Something like
  `'Preparing upload...'`, but be more specific if possible.

When `mode` is `'determinate'`, also add the `value` property:

- `value` - A progress value between 0 and 1.

#### `progress`

Fired each time the total upload progress is updated:

**Parameters**

- `progress` - An integer (0-100) representing the total upload progress.

**Example**

```js
uppy.on('progress', (progress) => {
	// progress: integer (total progress percentage)
	console.log(progress);
});
```

#### `upload-progress`

Fired each time an individual file upload progress is available:

**Parameters**

- `file` - The [Uppy file](#working-with-uppy-files) that has progressed.
- `progress` - The same object as in `file.progress`.

**Example**

```js
uppy.on('upload-progress', (file, progress) => {
	// file: { id, name, type, ... }
	// progress: { uploader, bytesUploaded, bytesTotal }
	console.log(file.id, progress.bytesUploaded, progress.bytesTotal);
});
```

#### `postprocess-progress`

Progress of the post-processors.

**Parameters**

`progress` is an object with properties:

- `mode` - Either `'determinate'` or `'indeterminate'`.
- `message` - A message to show to the user. Something like
  `'Preparing upload...'`, but be more specific if possible.

When `mode` is `'determinate'`, also add the `value` property:

- `value` - A progress value between 0 and 1.

#### `upload-success`

Fired each time a single upload is completed.

**Parameters**

- `file` - The [Uppy file](#working-with-uppy-files) that was uploaded.
- `response` - An object with response data from the remote endpoint. The actual
  contents depend on the upload plugin that is used.

For `@uppy/xhr-upload`, the shape is:

```json
{
	"status": 200, // HTTP status code (0, 200, 300)
	"body": "…", // response body
	"uploadURL": "…" // the file url, if it was returned
}
```

**Example**

```js
uppy.on('upload-success', (file, response) => {
	console.log(file.name, response.uploadURL);
	const img = new Image();
	img.width = 300;
	img.alt = file.id;
	img.src = response.uploadURL;
	document.body.appendChild(img);
});
```

#### `complete`

Fired when all uploads are complete.

The `result` parameter is an object with arrays of `successful` and `failed`
files, as in [`uppy.upload()`](#upload)’s return value.

```js
uppy.on('complete', (result) => {
	console.log('successful files:', result.successful);
	console.log('failed files:', result.failed);
});
```

#### `error`

Fired when Uppy fails to upload/encode the entire upload.

**Parameters**

- `error` - The error object.

**Example**

```js
uppy.on('error', (error) => {
	console.error(error.stack);
});
```

#### `upload-error`

Fired each time a single upload failed.

**Parameters**

- `file` - The [Uppy file](#working-with-uppy-files) which didn’t upload.
- `error` - The error object.
- `response` - an optional parameter with response data from the upload
  endpoint.

It may be undefined or contain different data depending on the upload plugin in
use.

For `@uppy/xhr-upload`, the shape is:

```json
{
	"status": 200, // HTTP status code (0, 200, 300)
	"body": "…" // response body
}
```

**Example**

```js
uppy.on('upload-error', (file, error, response) => {
	console.log('error with file:', file.id);
	console.log('error message:', error);
});
```

If the error is related to network conditions — endpoint unreachable due to
firewall or ISP blockage, for instance — the error will have
`error.isNetworkError` property set to `true`. Here’s how you can check for
network errors:

```js
uppy.on('upload-error', (file, error, response) => {
	if (error.isNetworkError) {
		// Let your users know that file upload could have failed
		// due to firewall or ISP issues
		alertUserAboutPossibleFirewallOrISPIssues(error);
	}
});
```

#### `upload-retry`

Fired when an upload has been retried (after an error, for example).

:::note

This event is not triggered when the user retries all uploads, it will trigger
the `retry-all` event instead.

:::

**Parameters**

- `fileID` - ID of the file that is being retried.

**Example**

```js
uppy.on('upload-retry', (fileID) => {
	console.log('upload retried:', fileID);
});
```

#### `upload-stalled`

Fired when an upload has not received any progress in some time (in
`@uppy/xhr-upload`, the delay is defined by the `timeout` option). Use this
event to display a message on the UI to tell the user they might want to retry
the upload.

```js
uppy.on('upload-stalled', (error, files) => {
	console.log('upload seems stalled', error, files);
	const noLongerStalledEventHandler = (file) => {
		if (files.includes(file)) {
			console.log('upload is no longer stalled');
			uppy.off('upload-progress', noLongerStalledEventHandler);
		}
	};
	uppy.on('upload-progress', noLongerStalledEventHandler);
});
```

#### `retry-all`

Fired when all failed uploads are retried

**Parameters**

- `fileIDs` - Arrays of IDs of the files being retried.

**Example**

```js
uppy.on('retry-all', (fileIDs) => {
	console.log('upload retried:', fileIDs);
});
```

#### `info-visible`

Fired when “info” message should be visible in the UI. By default, `Informer`
plugin is displaying these messages (enabled by default in `Dashboard` plugin).
You can use this event to show messages in your custom UI:

```js
uppy.on('info-visible', () => {
	const { info } = uppy.getState();
	// info: {
	//  isHidden: false,
	//  type: 'error',
	//  message: 'Failed to upload',
	//  details: 'Error description'
	// }
	console.log(`${info.message} ${info.details}`);
});
```

#### `info-hidden`

Fired when “info” message should be hidden in the UI. See
[`info-visible`](#info-visible).

#### `cancel-all`

| Argument | Type     | Description                         |
| -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `reason` | `string` | See [uppy.cancelAll](####cancelAll) |

Fired when `cancelAll()` is called, all uploads are canceled, files removed and
progress is reset.

#### `restriction-failed`

Fired when a file violates certain restrictions when added. This event is
providing another choice for those who want to customize the behavior of file
upload restrictions.

```js
uppy.on('restriction-failed', (file, error) => {
	// do some customized logic like showing system notice to users
});
```

#### `reset-progress`

Fired when `resetProgress()` is called, each file has its upload progress reset
to zero.

```js
uppy.on('reset-progress', () => {
	// progress was reset
});
```

## `new BasePlugin(uppy, options?)`

The initial building block for a plugin.

`BasePlugin` does not contain DOM rendering so it can be used for plugins
without an user interface.

:::info

See [`UIPlugin`][] for the extended version with Preact rendering for
interfaces.

:::

:::info

Checkout the [building plugins](/docs/guides/building-plugins) guide.

:::

:::note

If you don’t use any UI plugins and want to make sure Preact isn’t bundled into
your app, import `BasePlugin` like this:
`import BasePlugin from '@uppy/core/lib/BasePlugin`.

:::

### Options

The options passed to `BasePlugin` are all you options you wish to support in
your plugin.

You should pass the options to `super` in your plugin class:

```js
class MyPlugin extends BasePlugin {
	constructor(uppy, opts) {
		super(uppy, opts);
	}
}
```

### Methods

#### `setOptions(options)`

Options passed during initialization can also be altered dynamically with
`setOptions`.

#### `getPluginState()`

Retrieves the plugin state from the `Uppy` class. Uppy keeps a `plugins` object
in state in which each key is the plugin’s `id`, and the value its state.

#### `setPluginState()`

Set the plugin state in the `Uppy` class. Uppy keeps a `plugins` object in state
in which each key is the plugin’s `id`, and the value its state.

#### `install()`

The `install` method is ran once, when the plugin is added to Uppy with
`.use()`. Use this to initialize the plugin.

For example, if you are creating a pre-processor (such as
[@uppy/compressor](/docs/compressor)) you must add it:

```js
install () {
  this.uppy.addPreProcessor(this.prepareUpload)
}
```

Another common thing to do when creating a
[UI plugin](#new-uipluginuppy-options) is to [`mount`](#mounttarget) it to the
DOM:

```js
install () {
  const { target } = this.opts
  if (target) {
    this.mount(target, this)
  }
}
```

#### `uninstall()`

The `uninstall` method is ran once, when the plugin is removed from Uppy. This
happens when `.close()` is called or when the plugin is destroyed in a framework
integration.

Use this to clean things up.

For instance when creating a pre-processor, uploader, or post-processor to
remove it:

```js
uninstall () {
  this.uppy.removePreProcessor(this.prepareUpload)
}
```

When creating a [UI plugin](#new-uipluginuppy-options) you should
[`unmount`](#unmount) it from the DOM:

```js
uninstall () {
  this.unmount()
}
```

#### `i18nInit`

Call `this.i18nInit()` once in the constructor of your plugin class to
initialize [internationalisation](/docs/locales).

#### `addTarget`

You can use this method to make your plugin a `target` for other plugins. This
is what `@uppy/dashboard` uses to add other plugins to its UI.

#### `update`

Called on each state update. You will rarely need to use this, unless if you
want to build a UI plugin using something other than Preact.

#### `afterUpdate`

Called after every state update with a debounce, after everything has mounted.

## `new UIPlugin(uppy, options?)`

`UIPlugin` extends [`BasePlugin`][] to add rendering with
[Preact](https://preactjs.com/). Use this when you want to create an user
interface or an addition to one, such as [Dashboard][].

:::info

See [`BasePlugin`][] for the initial building block for all plugins.

:::

:::info

Checkout the [building plugins](/docs/guides/building-plugins) guide.

:::

### Options

The options passed to `UIPlugin` are all you options you wish to support in your
plugin.

You should pass the options to `super` in your plugin class:

```js
class MyPlugin extends UIPlugin {
	constructor(uppy, opts) {
		super(uppy, opts);
	}
}
```

In turn these are also passed to the underlying `BasePlugin`.

### Methods

All the methods from [`BasePlugin`][] are also inherited into `UIPlugin`.

#### `mount(target)`

Mount this plugin to the `target` element. `target` can be a CSS query selector,
a DOM element, or another Plugin. If `target` is a Plugin, the source (current)
plugin will register with the target plugin, and the latter can decide how and
where to render the source plugin.

#### `onMount()`

Called after Preact has rendered the components of the plugin.

#### `unmount`

Removing the plugin from the DOM. You generally don’t need to override it but
you should call it from [`uninstall`](#uninstall).

The default is:

```js
unmount () {
  if (this.isTargetDOMEl) {
    this.el?.remove()
  }
  this.onUnmount()
}
```

#### `onUnmount()`

Called after the elements have been removed from the DOM. Can be used to do some
clean up or other side-effects.

#### `render()`

Render the UI of the plugin. Uppy uses [Preact](https://preactjs.com) as its
view engine, so `render()` should return a Preact element. `render` is
automatically called by Uppy on each state change.

#### `update(state)`

Called on each state update. You will rarely need to use this, unless if you
want to build a UI plugin using something other than Preact.

## `debugLogger()`

Logger with extra debug and warning logs for during development.

```js
import { Uppy, debugLogger } from '@uppy/core';

new Uppy({ logger: debugLogger });
```

:::info

You can also enable this logger by setting [`debug`](#debug) to `true`.

:::

The default value of [`logger`](#logger) is `justErrorsLogger`, which looks like
this:

```js
// Swallow all logs, except errors.
// default if logger is not set or debug: false
const justErrorsLogger = {
	debug: () => {},
	warn: () => {},
	error: (...args) => console.error(`[Uppy] [${getTimeStamp()}]`, ...args),
};
```

`debugLogger` sends extra debugging and warning logs which could be helpful
during development:

```js
// Print logs to console with namespace + timestamp,
// set by logger: Uppy.debugLogger or debug: true
const debugLogger = {
	debug: (...args) => console.debug(`[Uppy] [${getTimeStamp()}]`, ...args),
	warn: (...args) => console.warn(`[Uppy] [${getTimeStamp()}]`, ...args),
	error: (...args) => console.error(`[Uppy] [${getTimeStamp()}]`, ...args),
};
```

## Frequently asked questions

### How do I allow duplicate files?

You can allow all files, even duplicate files, with
[`onBeforeFileAdded`](#onbeforefileadded). This will override the file if it has
not been uploaded. If you upload a duplicate file again it depends on your
upload plugin and backend how it is handled.

```js
const uppy = new Uppy({
  // ...
  onBeforeFileAdded: () => true,
```
