# Compressor

The `@uppy/compressor` plugin optimizes images (JPEG, PNG) before upload, saving
up to 60% in size (roughly 18 MB for 10 images). It uses
[Compressor.js](https://github.com/fengyuanchen/compressorjs) library under the
hood.

## When should I use it?

When your users are likely to upload images, potentially on mobile devices, and
saving data / faster uploading speed is important.

## Install

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM" default>

```shell
npm install @uppy/compressor
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```shell
yarn add @uppy/compressor
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="cdn" label="CDN">
    <UppyCdnExample>
      {`
        import { Uppy, Compressor } from "{{UPPY_JS_URL}}"
        const uppy = new Uppy()
        uppy.use(Compressor, {
          // Options
        })
      `}
    </UppyCdnExample>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Use

```js
import Uppy from '@uppy/core';
import Compressor from '@uppy/compressor';

new Uppy().use(Compressor);
```

No action is needed from the user — Uppy will automatically optimize images,
show an [Informer](/docs/user-interfaces/elements/informer) message with saved
bytes, and then begin the upload as usual.

## API

### Options

:::tip You can also pass any of the
[Compressor.js options](https://github.com/fengyuanchen/compressorjs#options)
here as well. :::

### `id`

A unique identifier for this plugin (`string`, default: `'Compressor'`).

### `quality`

The quality of the output image passed to
[Compressor.js](https://github.com/fengyuanchen/compressorjs) (`number`,
default: `0.6`)

It must be a number between `0` and `1`. Be careful to use `1` as it may make
the size of the output image become larger. In most cases, going with the
default value is best.

:::note This option is only available for `image/jpeg` and `image/webp` images.
:::

### `limit`

Number of images that will be compressed in parallel (`number`, default: `10`)

You likely don’t need to change this, unless you are experiencing performance
issues.

#### `locale`

```js
export default {
	strings: {
		// Shown in the Status Bar
		compressingImages: 'Compressing images...',
		compressedX: 'Saved %{size} by compressing images',
	},
};
```

## Events

#### `compressor:complete`

The event is emitted when all files are compressed. You can use it for side
effects or custom UI notifications.
