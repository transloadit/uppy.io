# Privacy Policy

Uppy is an open source file uploader, developed by the team at
[Transloadit Ltd.](https://transloadit.com) and
[open source contributors on GitHub](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/graphs/contributors).

In order to demonstrate Uppy file uploader and Transloadit’s file encoding
service on this website, we capture and store information about you.

## Who is responsible for data protection?

Since we are a small company, we do not have an external data officer. 
Responsible for data protection are Transloadit’s founders Tim Koschützki and Kevin van Zonneveld. 
You can reach them at [founders@transloadit.com](mailto:founders@transloadit.com).

## What data is collected?

We receive the following **data** from you:

1. IP addresses
2. Request headers
3. Data entered on our website
4. Information used to analyze usage of our platform via [Plausible](https://plausible.io), a self-hosted service that is GDPR compliant and anonymizes data on impact.
5. Files you can optionally upload in example demos. Those files are stored
   temporarily for 24–72 hours, on uppy.io, tus.io or transloadit.com servers,
   and then deleted. See also Transloadit’s Privacy Policy:
   <https://transloadit.com/legal/privacy/>.

All data that passes through demos is only used for demo purposes, and never
sold or otherwise given away.

Since we do not store data on data subjects, migration or deletion tools are not
applicable.

## Third-party services

We use the following third-party services which also store data about you:

- **anonymized**: Any data that can be used to identify the “data subject” is
  scrubbed
- **discarded**: Data is destroyed

## Your information and your rights

If you are based within the EEA (European Economic Area) or within another
jurisdiction that has similar data protection laws, under certain circumstances,

   information;
2. the right to have your information rectified or erased, or to place
   restrictions on processing your information;
3. the right to object to the processing of your information, e.g., for direct
   marketing purposes or where the processing is based on our legitimate
   interests;
4. the right to have any information you provided to us on an automated basis
   returned to you in a structured, commonly-used and machine-readable format,

   to withdraw that consent is subject to legal or contractual restrictions;
