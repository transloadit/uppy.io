# Privacy Policy

Uppy is an open source file uploader, developed by the team at
[Transloadit Ltd.](https://transloadit.com) and
[open source contributors on GitHub](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/graphs/contributors).

In order to demonstrate Uppy file uploader and Transloadit’s file encoding
service on this website, we capture and store information about you.

## Who is responsible for data protection?

Since we are operating with a staff of less than ten people, we do not have an
external data officer. Responsible for data protection are our founders Tim
Koschützki and Kevin van Zonneveld. You can reach them at
[founders@transloadit.com](mailto:founders@transloadit.com).

## What data is collected?

We receive the following **data** from you:

1. IP addresses
2. Request headers
3. Data entered on our website
4. The browser session (identified through a cookie)
5. Information used to analyze usage of our platform (through cookies from
   Google Analytics. More on cookies is explained below)
6. Files you can optionally upload in example demos. Those files are stored
   temporarily for 24–72 hours, on uppy.io, tus.io or transloadit.com servers,
   and then deleted. See also Transloadit’s Privacy Policy:
   <https://transloadit.com/legal/privacy/>.

All data that passes through demos is only used for demo purposes, and never
sold or otherwise given away.

Since we do not store data on data subjects, migration or deletion tools are not
applicable.

## Third-party services

We use the following third-party services which also store data about you:

## Changes to our privacy policy

We may change this privacy policy from time to time. Still, we will not reduce
your rights under this privacy policy. We will always update the privacy policy
on our website, so please try to read it when you visit the website (the “last

## Cookies, analytics and traffic data

Cookies are small text files that are transferred from our website and stored on
your device. We use cookies to help us provide you with a personalized service,
and to help make our website and service better for you.

Our cookies may be session cookies (temporary cookies that identify and track
users within our websites) which are deleted when you close your browser, or
persistent cookies (cookies that enable our website to “remember” who you are
and to remember your preferences within our website) which will stay on your
computer or device after you close your browser).

We use the following different types of cookies:

### Performance cookies and analytics technologies

Performance cookies collect information about how visitors and users use our
website. These cookies register, for example, which functionality our visitors
use most often, or if they receive error messages from certain areas of our
website. These cookies don’t collect information that can be used to identify a
visitor or user. All information collected by these cookies is aggregated and
thus anonymous. We only use these cookies to improve how our website works.

### Functionality cookies

Functionality cookies allow our website to remember the choices you make (such
as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced and
more personal features. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you
have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can
customize. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for. The
information collected by these cookies may be anonymized. They cannot track your
browsing activity on other websites.

### IP address and traffic data

We keep a record of the traffic data that is logged automatically by our
servers, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, device information, the
website that you visited before ours and the website you visit after leaving our
site. We also collect some site, application and service statistics, such as
access rates, page hits and page views. We are not able to identify any
individual from traffic data or site statistics.

#### Google Analytics

Our platform uses Google Analytics, which uses cookies. The information created
through these cookies about your usage of uppy.io will be transmitted to a
Google server in the United States of America and stored there. When you are
located in one of the states of the European Union, your IP address will be
anonymized on our platform before transmitting it. We use the code
`ga('set', 'anonymizeIp', true);` to make sure an anonymous way of saving IP
addresses (so-called IP-masking).

Google will use this information to analyze your usage of our platform and to
create reports about the activities on our platform. The IP address that will be
sent to Google as a result of Google Analytics will not be connected to any
other data on Google.

You can avoid any cookies being saved by changing the settings in your browser.
Please be aware that if you choose to do so, you might not be able to make full
use of our website and all its features. You can also prevent the analysis of
your browsing behavior on our platform through Google Analytics by installing
the following browser plugin: <http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>.
